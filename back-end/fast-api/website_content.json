    "content": "7 physician tax deductions for locum tenens doctors Jan 18, 2024 7 Min Read Dr.\nNii Darko Experienced locum physician Dr Nii Darko shares his insights on the tax benefits that are available to locum tenens physicians.\nAs a freshly graduated trauma/critical care surgeon, I had no idea that locum tenens existed.\nIt wasn’t until I had a less-than-favorable encounter while looking for a permanent position that I began to examine my options.\nUnderstanding the logistics of working as a locum was one thing, but understanding the tax implications of locum tenens was another.\nNow 10 years into working as an independent contractor, I’ve learned that the tax benefits can be pretty significant.\nKeep in mind that each individual's situation is unique.\nBe sure to consult with a qualified tax professional to find out how best to use these tax benefits for your particular situation.\nLocums tax guide So, if you are or are thinking about being a locum tenens doc, here are seven specific tax benefits that might be available to you.\n1.\nBusiness travel Did you know that driving your car to a locum assignment can result in a mileage tax deduction ? In some cases, a 100% deduction of the cost of the car, fuel (or charge for electric cars), and even car insurance is possible! For a long time, I had the facility rent a car for me and missed out on those deductions.\nNowadays, I drive my own car, and let’s just say that I have a smile on my face even in heavy traffic.\n2.\nMeals … for free? You can deduct the cost of meals while traveling for work as a locum tenens doctor.\nThis deduction is especially beneficial if you're working in a major city with a high cost of living.\nPersonally, I order a meal delivery service to be sent to my hotel before I arrive at my assignment.\nThis way, I can have more healthy options and a more predictable eating schedule.\nThe calories are low and so are the taxes! 3.\nContinuing Medical Education (CME) The cost of continuing medical education (CME) is 100% deductible for locum tenens doctors.\nThis deduction can really add up, especially if you're attending multiple conferences or courses throughout the year.\nRemember, as long as the expenses are business related, they may be eligible for tax deduction.\nNo need to confine yourself to online credits.\nGo to that conference in a tropical location if you’d like! 4.\nScrubs, gadgets, and equipment are all write-offs One of the many perks of being a locum tenens is deducting of the cost of your phone, gadgets, clothes, and medical equipment .\nUsing your phone, tablet, and/or computer in any work-related fashion can justify a tax deduction.\nNeed a new stethoscope, scrubs, scrub shoes, or white coat? Well, since you’d be using these during your locum assignment, they are tax deductible.\nSo, go ahead and stand in line overnight for that new iPhone! 5.\nFree or reduced lodging Wherever your assignment takes you, you can deduct your lodging.\nApart from seeing the world while doing what you love, you also get to visit and live in some pretty amazing places for free.\nMost locum tenens agencies will cover the cost of your lodging, so while not a real tax deduction, it certainly is a money saver.\nIf by some chance you have a hotel expense related to acquiring or working during an assignment, then a tax deduction is very likely.\n6.\nHome office deductions If you're working as a locum tenens doctor, there's a good chance you're doing at least some work-related business from home.\nWhether that’s taking phone calls, answering emails, doing conference calls, or telemedicine, designating a home office is a great way to get a tax deduction.\nYou can deduct a portion of your rent or mortgage, your utilities — including internet — and other home office expenses.\nI even have my business write a check for rent to make it more official and easier to document.\n7.\nHealth insurance Lots of docs worry about their ability to get health insurance as a physician independent contractor .\nWell, health insurance is available in the marketplace.\nBarring any special circumstances, any locum doctor should be able to get health insurance and get it deducted as a business expense.\nWhile I’ve worked as a locum for 10 years, six of those have been solely as an independently contracted locum doc.\nAs a husband and father, I have always been able to insure my family without lapse.\nFinal thoughts on tax deductions for locum tenens physicians There are more tax benefits available to locum tenens doctors .\nBe sure to talk to a licensed tax professional to help you take advantage of all the self-employed deductions available to you.\nIf you want to learn more about tax benefits, check out my Tax Series on Docs Outside the Box podcast.\nI talk with Certified Public Accountant and tax planner Eric McGlothen about how both employed and locum doctors can maximize their tax benefits.\nView our tax guides for locum doctors A physician's guide to locum tenens taxes Jan 10, 2024 7 physician tax deductions for locum tenens doctors Jan 18, 2024 2024 locum tenens pay trends: What specialties are up or down?

    "content": "Locum tenens travel: The ultimate guide Mar 25, 2024 7 Min Read Megan Lee Locums is an excellent way for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants to earn extra income, have more flexibility and control of their schedule, and experience working in many different clinical settings.\nIt’s also an excellent opportunity to see the world — whether it’s rural South Dakota, sunny San Diego, or even beautiful and diverse New Zealand .\nOnce you have decided to accept a locums assignment, that’s when the fun — and a bit of work — begins.\nHere’s what you can expect once you’ve landed your assignment.\nHow to get started with locums What travel is covered to/from my locum tenens assignment? Generally speaking, a locum tenens agency will pay for certain travel logistics for your assignment, including standard airfare and a rental car.\nHere’s a short list of what you can typically expect.\nAirfare: Your locums agency will likely book and pay for your flight in advance between your preferred home airport and the closest airport to your short-term assignments.\nAll that is asked of you is that you show up, check in (either online, in the app, or in-person), and get your boarding pass.\nRental car: Car rentals are also typically paid directly by the locums agency.\nTo pick up your car, you will report to the rental agency counter and provide a valid driver’s license.\nThen you can get the keys and hit the road.\nMileage: Sometimes, you may decide it’s easier or more convenient to drive your car to the assignment.\nIn that case, you can usually get reimbursed for the miles you travel at the IRS standard mileage rate .\nWhat isn’t covered when you fly So, are your travel expenses covered, or should you plan to be responsible for anything? Other add-ons will usually be your responsibility to pay for, such as seat upgrades, in-flight services and meals, and alcoholic beverages — and let’s be honest; these things make being stuck in a flying tin can more enjoyable.\nBut, as we all know, they’re no longer free.\nWi-Fi access and early boarding are also not normally covered.\nOn the bright side, remember that as a 1099 contract employee, some travel-related expenses may be tax deductible.\nSave your receipts and consult your tax advisor to learn more.\nSo, how do I get to my locum tenens assignment? Flying Once you and your agency have found your ideal assignment, this is where the legwork begins — but not your legwork.\nAt this point, your rep gets to work.\nIf your assignment requires flying, they’ll work on securing a flight that accommodates your schedule and preferred airports.\nThe best part? In most cases, no money comes out of your pockets.\nAfter you have landed at your destination and retrieved your bags, you can advance to the next stage of getting to your actual assignment.\nThis may include hopping in a rideshare to a nearby hotel or heading to the rental car counter to pick up your vehicle.\nYour locums placement agency will arrange all these logistics, immensely simplifying your travel planning and coordinating.\nDriving Depending on the distance to your destination, you might consider driving to your placement rather than flying.\nTenured locum physician Nicholas Kusnezov, MD, shares, “If driving is at all possible — even if it involves a 4- or 6-hour trip — it is tremendously more time-efficient and reliable than flights.” He also adds that driving your vehicle has its perks.\n“Driving ultimately gives you complete control of your time and avoids inefficiencies which develop from third parties — such as flight delays or issues with rental cars.” Another perk of driving yourself? You can pack more bulky comforts from home, like books and sporting gear.\nIn these instances, keep tabs on your gas mileage and submit any gasoline receipts for reimbursement.\nMore considerations for flyers Additional factors to remember if you plan to fly to your destination.\nWindow or aisle? Alert your rep Remember, your agency rep is working to ensure you have the best flight experience they can get you.\nWhile you won’t be on the line with an airline representative, you need to let them know what your preferences are, such as: Window, aisle, or middle seat The time of day you prefer traveling: morning, afternoon, or evening What your airline reward numbers are Other special requirements The staffing agency will probably give you multiple travel options, and once your flight is booked, you’ll receive a confirmation letter or email spelling out all the details.\nHow to leverage travel loyalty/rewards programs You may wonder: I have frequent flyer miles and want to collect the points I earn.\nHow will that work? Here’s the low down: Most staffing agencies will allow you to manage your rewards and collect reward points for any airline, car rental, or hotel program you belong to.\nIf the agency is booking your travel, provide them with your relevant loyalty account numbers and brand preferences so they can be added to the reservation.\nFor even more advice on optimizing your points and miles earnings, turn to White Coat Investor, where Dr.\nDavid Rosen shares his tips on Travel Hacking for Students, Residents, and Those Entering the World of Credit Card Rewards.\nCan I book my flight? If you prefer to book your flight, most agencies will reimburse you for the cost — unless you feel the itch to fly first class and sip on some champagne, in which case the agency will usually only reimburse for reasonable and customary expenses.\nHow does travel booking work for your family? Many doctors like to bring their families along and make the trip a working family vacation.\nStaffing agencies will often help with the travel arrangements for family members.\nHowever, you are usually required to pay for their airfare.\nIf you plan to use frequent flyer miles to cover the cost of your loved ones’ airfares, you’ll likely have to arrange that yourself.\nDriving- and rental car-related logistics Whether you’re driving to an assignment or need to get around town once you are there, there are considerations to keep in mind when using a car while on assignment.\nPaying for your car rental The staffing agency usually pays for car rentals, but sometimes, you may need to pay upfront and get reimbursed later.\nBe prepared to cover this expense at the onset.\nIf this is not feasible, try to make sure the locums agency can pay the car rental agency directly instead.\nCar rental insurance is usually paid for as well.\nIf you choose to upgrade your vehicle, the staffing agency may only pay or reimburse the standard rental cost, while you’re responsible for the difference.\nTolls, parking, and fuel Where there is travel, there is cost.\nYou’ll encounter parking fees, toll roads, fuel costs, and insurance when driving on an assignment.\nYou’re probably wondering if the agency will cover the cost or if you’ll need to be reimbursed.\nShort answer? Yes…to both.\nIf you’re driving — whether your car or a rental — you’ll usually be reimbursed for Fuel costs (rental cars only) Mileage (for your car, at IRS mileage reimbursement rate ) You are not reimbursed for the following: Toll fees Gas for rental Speeding/parking tickets Car insurance for your own car Never forget to save your receipts.\nPersonal use If you choose to rent a car, some rules for personal use usually apply: Staffing agency-provided rental cars are intended for use while on assignment and for reasonable personal use when you’re not at work.\nIf you plan to arrive early for your assignment or are staying longer for vacation or other personal activities, you should return the rental car, rent another on your own, or make arrangements with the agency to pay the difference.\nInsurance considerations and risks Whether the staffing agency pays for the rental car or you get your own, getting insurance is best.\nSome agencies even carry secondary policies that cover the deductible, but certain activities can negate your insurance coverage: Driving the car to another country, such as Canada or Mexico Driving with an invalid driver’s license Driving under the influence Using the vehicle for an unintended purpose, such as driving on an unpaved road Consider the season and terrain If you are used to driving along a grid and have an assignment up in rural mountain areas, or if you’re picking up an assignment in New York state during a snowy winter, adjust your rental car plans.\n“If you ever work in the Northeast, Midwest, or any mountainous areas in the winter, you better be prepared.\nThe key here is to have a reliable car that would make your driving seamless,” says hospitalist Vlad Dzhashi, MD, also known as the Locum Tenens Guy .\nDr.\nDzhashi recommends choosing only an all-wheel drive sports utility vehicle or truck in wintry conditions.\nIdeally, the car will also have special seasonal tires.\nFor those seeking international locum tenens placements Pack like a pro Airlines limit the amount of luggage you're allowed to check, and sometimes weight restrictions.\nBe sure to look at each leg of your flight: if you're switching to a carrier with a lower limit, you might get hit with additional fees.\nPack to the lowest common denominator across carriers.\nPack as lightly as it feels comfortable to you.\nPlan to purchase large toiletries in the country rather than packing that liter of shampoo.\nWear your heaviest shoes and jacket on the plane.\nIf possible, stick to one checked bag; your future self will thank you.\nEver wonder how locum tenens pros pack for their assignments? This veteran locum shares his packing tips: Manage your money wisely Check to see if your bank has branches at your travel destination.\nThis may mean more access to in-network ATMs or other support.\nSavvy international locum tenens workers call their banks and credit card companies to tell them what days they’ll be traveling and what locations they intend to visit.\nThis should help you avoid (most) hiccups when accessing your money abroad.\nTo that end, have a backup plan.\nBring some U.S.\ndollars as emergency currency and more than one credit card (store them in two different spots on your person).\nSnap a pic of your credit cards before traveling; though a lost or stolen card is guaranteed to be a hassle, it'll be easier to manage if you have a copy of the card.\nBe mindful of how often you pull money from an ATM, as you may get dinged with international ATM fees.\nDo one better by bringing a card that reimburses ATM fees or doesn’t charge for out-of-network withdrawals.\nGrab a SIM card If you have an unlocked smartphone, plan to get a SIM card at the airport upon arrival or in town shortly after settling in.\nIf adding a SIM card to your existing phone is not an option available to you, consider going the route of buying a basic phone in the country.\nThis will help you stay in communication with your placement and agency rep.\nAdditional safety risks and considerations Use taxis and rideshares safely and look like you know where you're going.\nThis means you should use (and hide) your phone strategically to avoid cell phone theft.\nBe mindful of the culture and traditions of the country you are working in so that you may be more likely to blend in and be seen as respectful.\nWhile wearing your favorite watch or fancy jewelry can be nice, bling might draw unwanted attention, so it's better to leave the Rolex at home.\nTravel day advice for locum tenens physicians Get travel protections Pediatrician Dr.\nTrevor Cabrera, a veteran locum tenens physician, refers to his personal Locum Tenens Checklist ahead of each assignment to streamline his preparations.\nOne step is “Emergency Travel Planning.” “Having emergency roadside assistance is always a good idea for a flat tire, and sometimes travel protection can be beneficial for flights.” Keep your medical equipment TSA-compliant — or check it Refer to the Transportation Security Administration’s website to learn what items are cleared for carry-on hand luggage versus checked baggage.\nMost items will be eligible to be brought on the plane, but they must be disclosed to the TSA officer as you go through security.\nThat said, not all items are allowed.\nIn general, carry on anything you can't afford to lose.\nExamples of items typically accepted in your carry-on include a stethoscope, reflex hammer, pen lights, and tuning fork.\nVlad Dzhashi, MD, recommends TSA PreCheck for those with frequent locum tenens assignments.\n“If you fly more than a few times a year, TSA precheck is a MUST.\nYou don’t have to wait in lines going through security checkpoints, and you’ll have extra time before your flight since you can come to the airport as late as one hour before your flight’s departure.” Know the rules: U.S.\nDepartment of State for advice for Americans traveling abroad .\nStay in touch with your rep Nicholas Kusnezov, MD, offers this travel advice: “Whenever traveling, always make sure to keep the locums agency, specifically your representative and travel agent, apprised of any delays, cancellations, or issues that arise during transit.\nThis ensures that the company can not only troubleshoot travel issues in real-time as they arise, but they can keep the destination hospital in the loop regarding any delays instead of them finding out last minute and scrambling for coverage, and make sure you have an after-hours contact number.” How much do locums make? Now it’s time to hit the road! Working with a staffing agency can make your travel to, from, and during your assignment smoother and simpler than if you were left to your own devices.\nDon’t ever hesitate to ask your agency’s provider representatives to clarify anything that may be unclear.\nTheir goal is to make your locum tenens travel experience as simple, painless, and comfortable for you and your family.\nFinally, remember that these are general guidelines for locum tenens travel, and every agency will have its policies and procedures for handling locum tenens travel.\nBon voyage!

    "content": "Why doctors choose locum tenens, and why they recommend it Apr 19, 2024 7 Min Read Dave Nielsen Doctors are often surprised by the benefits of locum tenens — better pay , more time with family, freedom from office politics, just to name a few.\nHere are some physicians who tell us why they choose to work locum tenens and recommend it to their fellow physicians.\nTake the quiz: Is locums right for me? Higher earning potential for locum tenens physicians Psychiatrist Dr.\nGreg Carr had a full-time job lined up when he finished his residency.\nThere was only one problem: The hospital in Hawaii that wanted to hire him needed four months to complete credentialing and licensing that full-time employment required.\nBut Dr.\nCarr didn’t have four months.\nHe needed to start earning a paycheck now.\nHis solution? How about a four-month locum tenens assignment in Hawaii while the hospital worked on the paperwork? As soon as it was done, he could sign the paperwork and begin his full-time position.\nThe hospital agreed, and Dr.\nCarr soon had boots on the ground, laying the groundwork for what he thought was going to be a dream job.\nTo call what happened next a rude awakening wouldn’t be fair.\nDr.\nCarr enjoyed his responsibilities and the people he was working with.\nBut little by little he was noticing something: “I realized that in Hawaii, the locum doctors were happier because they were getting paid more.\nAs a locum tenens physician myself, I didn’t have the burden of the call on the weekend.\nThe doctors that were full time — there was kind of this underlying jealousy because the locums were getting paid better and had more freedom.\nI started to realize, hey, it’s not so bad being a locum! And if I hadn’t begun the assignment as a locum physician, I wouldn’t have had the freedom to move to another facility easily.” Power to be your own boss Locum tenens gave Dr.\nCarr the power to choose when and where he wanted to work.\nWhen his first contract ended, he merely passed on the full-time offer and took a new locums contract elsewhere.\nToday, he sees locums as something in between working for the company and working for himself.\n“Some people are entrepreneurs, some are not,” he says.\n“For the people in the middle — locums could really help you test the waters of being your own boss.” Locum physician Dr.\nWilliam Barrett , a general surgeon, would echo this sentiment.\nAfter 16 years in traditional, full-time employment, he decided he wanted more control over his career and life; there were other interests he wanted to pursue.\nHe remembered the benefits of working locums for a few months after his residency and decided to go back.\n“I think I have more of an independent mindset,” he says, happy now in his role as a long-term locum physician .\n“I have time to schedule the vacations that I want.\nI don’t have to negotiate with partners or with employers to get maybe half the time that I want, which is what it used to be like.” He also has the freedom to do more volunteer work, which, depending on the year, can be a big priority.\n“When I was working full time, I didn’t have any time to do that,” he says, “and it’s something that I really enjoy.\nI work with a couple of organizations.\nIf they’re on a particular mission that's something I want to contribute a lot to — with locums, I have the flexibility to do that.” When Dr.\nBarrett isn’t working or volunteering, he’s visiting friends — another facet of his life that locums makes both easier and more fulfilling.\n“I have a tremendous variety of friends,” he says, “basically, around the world right now.\nThat’s one of the reasons why I like to do locums.\nI like to visit them and do things with them.\nIf I was working full time, I just can’t do those things.” New opportunities to sharpen your skills Orthopedic surgeon Dr.\nNicholas Kusnezov sees locums as an important opportunity doctors can use to experience new settings and expand their expertise beyond what they may have achieved in medical school and residency.\nAs an up-and-coming orthopedic surgeon, he says, “you may end up in a practice that confines you to a certain ‘niche.’ For instance, you might be the orthopedic ‘shoulder’ guy, stuck filling your schedule with procedures you may not be passionate about, while your partner ends up siphoning all the sought-after total joint replacements.” A good way to avoid getting in these ruts, Dr.\nKusnezov says, is to work locums.\n“Locums offers the potential to selectively diversify and control the scope of your practice,” he says, “and thereby increase your professional experience and skill set.” In his view, locum tenens is a proactive response to the challenge of staying on top of advancements in medicine.\n“Medicine is a dynamic, ever-changing field that is advancing at an accelerated pace,” he says.\n“Locums will expose you to a variety of different settings, medical staff, and novel concepts in diagnosis and management, which will in turn keep you sharp, relevant, and up-to-date with the state of the art.” See the country, make extra money, gain more clinical experience, and see how other facilities work: Pediatrician Dr.\nTrevor Cabrera shares why he and other doctors work locum tenens.\nChance to make a difference Otolaryngologist Dr.\nKimberly Atiyeh can second all of the reasons Dr.\nCarr, Dr.\nBarrett, and Dr.\nKusnezov might give to a fellow physician thinking about locum tenens.\n“Toward the end of my fellowship, I knew I wasn’t ready to make a decision about what I wanted for my ‘real job,’” says Dr.\nAtiyeh.\n“I knew I needed more time.\nLocums gave me flexibility to continue my job search and not feel pressure to take the first job that I could.” In her words, it gave her a chance to “relax.” Dr.\nAtiyeh has likewise come to appreciate locums for the independent lifestyle it’s granted her.\nOver the years, she’s used her time off between contracts to visit friends in other states, participate in academic conferences, and, of course, spend more time with family.\nHer sister’s Iron Man triathlon has been a particular highlight.\n“I was able to actually be there for her and partake in all the events surrounding it.” One key locums benefit that Dr.\nAtiyeh believes is one of locum’s most rewarding, is the opportunity to help out at hospitals and clinics that desperately need her help .\nThis affords her the opportunity to provide specialized care to patients who otherwise wouldn’t have access to it.\nThanks to locums, she’s at the right place at the right time to make a difference.\n“The people who are there are working their butts off and seeing a ton of patients and trying to get them in as soon as possible,” she says.\n“They are just really, really overworked.\nWhen I show up and patients come in to see me, they are so thankful and so appreciative to see me.” Committed to making a difference: Hear one locum tenens physician's story of giving back in underserved communities: Recommended by doctors everywhere Being a doctor is hard, and the day-to-day grind

    "content": "No matter where you are in the world, the primary goal is to take care of patients Nov 01, 2017 7 Min Read Jordan Gaddis When Dr.\nSean Ryan, a psychiatrist, finished his residency at U.C.\nSan Diego, he was already considering an international locum tenens position.\nWhat he didn’t know was that in less than five years, he’d find himself at a welcoming ceremony in New Zealand, preparing to lead the Maori mental health team for a local hospital.\nMuch to his wife’s surprise, at the ceremony, she was asked to sing a song about where her family was from! Dr.\nRyan remembers fondly, “Fortunately our daughter was young at the time, and we had a CD with a lot of old American children’s music, so [my wife] sang Shenandoah; she wants me to find out in the future if that’s going to happen again—ahead of time.” Surprises aside, Dr.\nRyan found the culture extraordinarily welcoming, and he adjusted quickly—to moving s-l-o-w-l-y.\nUnlike the fast-paced, individualistic culture he was used to in the United States, this environment moved slowly and focused on collectivism.\nThe change in pace proved beneficial in some ways, such as allowing patients to stay in the hospital longer, “really until they’re well.” And the collectivist aspect of practicing medicine meant that Dr.\nRyan gained new perspective on how to treat patients.\n“Adjusting to a medical system where societal rights supersede individual rights was a bit of an adjustment,” he said.\n“It really is about how treatment of the patient will impact the community rather than how it will impact [the patient].” With the assignment in New Zealand behind him, Dr.\nRyan arrived for six months in Tasmania, Australia, feeling ready to push himself and make things happen.\nBy that time he’d settled into the idea that no matter where you are in the world, the primary goal is to take care of patients, and that never changes.\n“You always do that the best you can,” he says.\nEven if it means practicing in open-air facilities without air conditioning! Locums Travel Can Be a Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience Dr.\nRyan’s focus on patients was satisfying work, but he also found plenty of time to play.\nFrom hiking behind their house through a forest to trips around the country and beyond, he and his wife enjoyed many adventures during his international locums assignments.\nHe was given a generous three weeks off for each six months in New Zealand and in Australia, and he used it to explore the entire area, including the surrounding islands.\nHe recalls two unique trips while in New Zealand that he’ll never forget.\nOne was through “glow worm caves that were spectacular to see,” he says, explaining black water rafting and how they rode on inner tubes through a river under the earth, gazing up at “glow worms that look like stars in the sky.” His second trip involved cooler temps through mountains and snow glaciers, and he cultivated his love of marine wildlife on the south island.\n[caption id=\"attachment_315\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"] Dr.\nSean Ryan[/caption] Yes, Yes, Yes—Dr.\nRyan Would Jump at the Chance to do International Locums Again Considering international locum tenens? “I would say first thing, don’t even hesitate, just start looking into it,” says Dr.\nRyan.\n“It feels very overwhelming to think about going so far away for who knows how long, but it’s really a lot easier, especially with a locums company who assists you throughout the whole process.” As an experienced locums, he believes in allowing yourself to take part in the local culture and meet new people while you’re abroad.\nHe learned not to hold back, and he recommends others do the same because it doesn’t matter what country or state you’re in, “the primary goal is to take care of patients and you always do the best you can.” He emphasizes that, “You all have the same goals, so if you just settle into that idea, you’ll have a much better experience.” These days, Dr.\nRyan stays a little closer to home and enjoys the convenience of locums so he can set his own schedule and make extra money in a way that meets his needs.\nHe loves the flexibility and the compensation, and when he travels to Santa Cruz, he also loves revisiting his days of watching ocean life in New Zealand, except this time his critter of choice is sea otters.\nIt may be at least five years away, but he’s already plotting his next international adventure: “I can’t wait for my next locum!” How locum tenens was the ideal path straight out of residency Jun 08, 2024 From locums right out of residency to teaching residents Jun 28, 2024 Freebies and discounts for physicians and advanced practice providers: Winter 2022-23 edition Nov 28, 2022 Categories Benefits of locum tenens Compensation & taxes Early career International locum tenens Late career Locums for NPs Locums for PAs Locums how-to Provider perspectives"

With the right help and guidance, foreign-born physicians can work locum tenens and enjoy the same lifestyle benefits as other locum physicians.\nHowever, the key phrase here is “with the right help and guidance.” This isn’t a route you’ll want to travel alone! But if your personal circumstances line up well, working locum tenens could be a rewarding part of your medical career.\nLocums: Is it for you? What are J-1 and H-1B visas? Most foreign-born physicians begin their careers in the United States on a J-1 visa , which allows a foreign-born medical graduate to live there for up to seven years for medical training.\nAt the end of seven years, the physician must return home for at least two years before applying for another visa.\nHowever, there are exceptions.\nIf a physician wants to stay in the United States, the most common solution is to apply for a J-1 waiver.\nWhile getting a J-1 waiver isn’t simple, once approved, a physician can apply for an H-1B visa and stay for another three years.\nAn H-1B visa can be renewed once for another three years.\nSo, a physician on an H-1B visa has six years to work in the U.S.\nbefore obtaining a more permanent residence status, such as a Green Card .\nApplying for a J-1 waiver If you’re a foreign-born physician looking for your first post-residency job, let’s be honest: the immigration process in the United States is complicated.\nTo apply for a J-1 waiver, you must first obtain a job offer from a practice or hospital willing to sponsor you and help you receive an H-1B visa.\nThis means you must know where and who you want to work for from the beginning.\nLater, if you change your mind, you probably won’t be able to transfer the J-1 waiver to a new sponsoring organization.\nAnother challenge is that United States immigration laws only allow a certain number of J-1 waivers to be issued yearly in each state.\nThe chances of getting a waiver vary, depending on which state you plan to work in (for example, underserved areas need more doctors but have a more challenging time attracting them).\nSome federal agencies also issue J-1 waivers for primary care doctors and a few physician specialties, but only when specific requirements are met.\nWhether you hope to work in a non-profit, for-profit, or government setting, applying for a J-1 waiver can be long and extensive, so beginning early is essential.\nThe sooner you start, the better your chances of getting one.\nThis means starting your job search early and deciding on something as quickly as possible.\nAs you can imagine, a fair amount of stress will be involved here.\nAny corrections you must make to the paperwork will cost you time, money, and maybe even the opportunity itself.\nWant to dig deeper? Here's more information on how to work locums on a J-1 visa (CompHealth) Locum tenens for foreign-born physicians Only some foreign-born physicians interested in working locum tenens will be able to meet all the legal requirements, but those who do and choose to go that route will enjoy significant control over their lifestyle and career.\nFor example, locum tenens physicians don’t have to know what city or state they want to spend the rest of their careers in.\nAssignments are temporary and can last as little as a few days, months, or even years.\nIf you’re a foreign-born physician, you could use locums to experience different regions of the country and try out different work scenarios before zeroing in on where you might want to stay long-term.\nAnother benefit? Schedule flexibility .\nLocum tenens physicians can schedule as much time off between assignments as they need.\nThis is huge for physicians with family and friends living elsewhere.\nAs a locum tenens physician, you’ll have unlimited time off to visit them.\nQualifying for locum tenens employment on an H-1B visa Suppose you’re understanding how visas work for foreign-born physicians.\nIn that case, you should see the problem with going locums right away: to obtain your J-1 waiver and H-1B visa, you need the sponsorship of the hospital or practice that’s hiring you as their permanent employee.\nHowever, in most cases, locum tenens physicians work as 1099 independent contractors, not W-2 employees.\nOne way to solve this problem as a foreign-born physician is to form a corporation.\nYour corporation would hire you full time and sponsor you for your J-1 waiver and H-1B visa.\nOf course, it’s not as simple as that.\nCreating a corporation to hire yourself for locum tenens contract work isn’t something you do during your lunch break.\nYou’ll need to create a board of directors to validate your credentials and meet other organizational or structural requirements.\nUnderstanding the waivers and visas accompanying the process can be equally daunting.\nThis is where an experienced immigration attorney comes in.\nAnn Badmus, principal attorney of Badmus & Associates , a firm that specializes in immigration issues, says, “If you are going to do an entrepreneurial H-1B visa, you will need to structure your company so that there are others, typically physicians, involved in the organization as part of the board of directors or board of managers.\nThen the government is comfortable that you’re not the only person that can control your work, even though you’re 100% the company owner.” The financial side of locums: Hear one experienced locum physician’s financial strategy (Weatherby Healthcare) Working locum tenens on a H-1B visa Once your corporation is in place, you can work as a locum tenens physician.\nOf course, you’ll also want the support and guidance of a locum tenens agency that has worked with foreign-born physicians and knows the challenges you’ll be facing.\nWhen it comes time to get paid, the locum tenens agency or healthcare facility you’re working with will pay your newly formed corporation and issue all the relevant 1099 forms directly to the corp.\nBut as the corporation’s only employee, all that money is typically yours to disburse — as a paycheck, benefits payments, retirement investments, and other expenses as needed.\nThis legal arrangement allows a foreign-born physician to work in locums.\nThe process takes time, effort, and even some money upfront.\nMany foreign-born physicians who work locum tenens do it on the side to supplement their primary employment.\nThis is especially true for physicians working in the U.S.\non a J-1 waiver, which requires that physicians work at least 40 hours a week.\n\"They still need an established practice and work for that practice at least 40 hours a week,” Badmus says.\n“A locums company can’t usually guarantee certain work hours, so these physicians typically set up their practice and do a concurrent H-1B.\nThey have their primary H-1B through their employer and a part-time H-1B through their company.” Other considerations for foreign-born physicians It’s important to note that hiring yourself through your corporation could make it more complicated, in time, for a foreign-born physician to obtain a Green Card when your H-1B visa expires.\nBe sure to consult with your lawyer and the locum agency you work through, especially if permanent residence in the United States is your long-term goal.\nFinally, there are at least four different types of business visas that a foreign-born physician could apply for.\nThe J-1 waiver, followed by the H-1B visa, is the most common pathway.\nThe requirements for the other visas are for doctors in more specific circumstances.\nStill, these visas are worth learning about.\nHave more questions about locum tenens? We have the answers Other physicians have done it.\nSo can you.\nGetting the opinion of an experienced locum tenens agent might be an excellent place to start.\nThey’ll answer your questions and give you important advice that could improve your chances of obtaining the necessary waivers and visas.\nWith the growing shortage of doctors , those chances are getting better yearly.\nThey may even present you with an option you didn’t know about.\nYou’ll never know until you talk to someone.\nAs the saying goes, information is power.\nDon’t wait — start the conversation today!

    "content": "Paying off medical school debt: 10 years with PSLF or 3 years with locum tenens? May 06, 2022 7 Min Read Dr.\nTrevor Cabrera Trevor Cabrera, MD, shares his strategy for paying off medical school debt more quickly and why he chose to go full-time locum tenens.\nLike many who have walked the gauntlet of medical training in the United States, when I graduated residency in 2020 I found myself carrying a staggering amount of medical school debt: a modest $315,000.\nThis medical “mortgage” didn’t include undergraduate debt (of which I was lucky to have none), any personal debts (e.g.\ncredit cards), or the miniscule income-based repayments I attempted to contribute throughout residency.\nI found myself faced with a tough decision: to take a “traditional” job as a pediatrician or take the road less traveled and become a locum tenens physician.\nI considered many factors, calculated the risks and benefits, drew up spreadsheet after spreadsheet, and ultimately decided to take a risk and jumped full-time into locums.\nWhat is locums? An accelerated medical student debt repayment strategy With the volatility of pediatric work in the era of COVID-19, I budgeted for a few months towards the end of and after residency to have a small emergency fund — knowing I might possibly not see work for weeks or even months.\nEventually, I reached a point of financial stability — not profit — and steady enough work that I decided to sell a majority of my possessions (including my 2009 Hyundai Sonata), terminate my lease, and never look back.\nBy traveling from locums job to locums job with only 24 to 48 hours between, and having my airfare, rentals, and lodging accounted for by locum tenens reimbursements , I estimated I would save a minimum of $25-30,000 per year.\nIncluding what I consider “wants” and not “needs,” I’m sure there’s much more saved that I can’t even account for.\nI eat as much free food as I can from the hospital, and when I have recurrent jobs, I take advantage of storing some reusable items in the clinic or hospital in extra storage rooms (with permission of course), further reducing my expenditures.\nDouble the income working locums My monthly locum tenens income alone is close to double that of all “traditional” jobs I could have taken, and more than 50% of my YEARLY income as a resident.\nI’m doing what I love as a pediatrician but making a salary close to an orthopedic surgeon.\nAfter accounting for my taxes as an independent contractor , shifting some money into retirement funds and savings, and setting aside a “wellness” fund, the rest goes straight to my loans — roughly 40% of my monthly adjusted gross income.\nI definitely work a lot, giving myself roughly 4-6 days off per month, but by making loan repayment a priority, I’m watching the total figure dwindle at an ever-increasing rate.\nLocum tenens vs.\nloan forgiveness programs My medical school debt consists of 1/3 from a private lender with the remaining 2/3 from the federal government.\nFor years preceding and during medical school I read about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program .\nI had the grandiose idea of having my loans forgiven after 10 years of non-profit or academic work and began making payments through the income-driven repayment plan (IDR) .\nHowever, with growing political concern over the longevity of the program as well my acknowledgment that my private loans wouldn’t be privy to this plan, I got out a calculator and rethought my plan.\nAfter hours of crunching numbers, I figured that while the PSLF could have me debt free in 10 years — possibly doing jobs I wouldn’t love — locums could have me there in 3 years or less, doing only what I wanted.\nFast forward to 12 months after my completion of Residency and I’ve completely paid off my private loans, over $100,000.\nWorking hard to achieve the lifestyle I want Now, given how much I work and channel earnings towards loans, a big question that my friends and family ask is if this audacious plan leaves me anytime for fun, anytime for a life? The short answer is probably not, I work harder as an attending than I did as a resident, but the larger picture I’m married to is definitely yes.\nI’m lucky to love my day-to-day “job” and hardly feel as if I’m working, but I’m not exempt from physical and mental exhaustion.\nSo, I am sure to schedule in extra days for enjoyment or exploration.\nIn New Mexico, I’ve scheduled extra days off to see the desert and climb the mountains.\nIn Maine, I worked in an extra week to drive up the coast and eat every lobster roll I could find.\nI’ve even managed to make time for visiting friends and family — things I only dreamed of during residency.\nYet, the best part of all is that to date I’ve accumulated enough hotel, airline, and rental points to take a paid month of vacation anywhere in the world.\nSince I make my own schedule working locums , I can do it whenever I want.\nAt the end of the day, I’ve taken on some risks working exclusively as a locum tenens provider, but the reward has been exponential!

    "content": "Locum tenens pointers: From one resigrad to another Jan 09, 2023 7 Min Read Dr.\nTrevor Cabrera Veteran locum physician Dr.\nTrevor Cabrera offers his pointers and perspectives to newly graduated residents about locum tenens.\nMost providers working locum tenens have traditionally done so as an adjunct to some sort of other stable “permanent” job, as a bridge between jobs , or as they are slowly edging their way into semi-retirement after toiling away at a tenured position for an entire career.\nRegardless of the reason — for family, freedom, or to altruistically care for indigent populations in underserved parts of the country or the world — a majority have generally served some time established in their field as an attending physician prior to working locum tenens.\nFor many reasons, including life stability, experience among peers, and establishment of a practice mentality, this makes sense.\nHowever, healthcare has evolved.\nThe growing desire of young physicians is to seek a deviation from the historic norm, and with a changing workforce, more and more new physicians immediately after residency training find themselves considering locum tenens work.\nAs one of those new graduates in the last few years, with very few before me to look to for questions, guidance, and warnings, I want to give my perspective on the things I wish I would have done or known as a brand-new graduate — affectionally termed a resigrad.\nLocums for resi-fellows Maintain relationships with mentors Recently, a senior resident contacted me for advice on starting out his career working locum tenens, with specific questions of where to find a mentor and what to do if he had questions and there’s no one nearby.\nWell, frankly, if you chose this path, there will be many unknowns.\nWorking locum tenens pushes physicians to use their critical thinking skills and become creative practicing medicine.\nI remember during the first several months as a new attending, there were many late nights that I would call back to speak to my mentors from training.\nI will never forget the difficult cases I would occasionally run by them as I decided what the next best step would be on my own.\nFurther, it is absolutely critical that physicians collect multiple references from training to serve as attestations for each new job as the connections are generally only valid for 24 months.\nThis last point cannot be emphasized enough, especially as you move from one facility to another.\nWhat do locums do about benefits? Prior to graduating residency, I was sure to expand my individual disability insurance, at the least to allow a rider for further expansion down the line.\nNegotiating other benefits such as health and dental insurance as a locum tenens can be difficult, and is something that should be considered carefully prior to starting.\nWhile I purchased my insurance through the Healthcare Marketplace , holding a part-time W-2 job in addition to working locums is sometimes useful to allow some sort of personal coverage in case of emergency.\nPlan out certifications, licenses, and renewals Paying attention to deadlines and renewal guidelines for medical licenses and DEA certificates obtained throughout the end of training can be useful.\nI would recommend waiting as long as you can to seek reimbursement for the above in potential job opportunities.\nYou can also consider self-purchase of a license or even obtaining your licenses through the IMLC if you plan on exclusively working locums.\nIt also becomes significantly harder to find renewal programs for CPR certificates after training.\nAs many programs are built into academic institutions to renew basic life-savings skills, I wish I had taken advantage of their discounts and ease at the end of my training.\nTaxes are tedious Consider establishing a tax home in a state without income taxes.\nPost office boxes are great for business mail.\nFollow the law, and when it gets complicated, finding a good accountant might be worthwhile.\nIf you are a daring entrepreneurs, establish an LLC , read the books, and figure out ways to legally traverse the system as an independent contractor; but, humbly remember you are a healthcare provider, most likely not a tax expert, yet.\nLEARN MORE: 7 tax benefits of being a locum tenens doctor Stay organized From day one, keep track of your malpractice certificates of liability insurance, keep spreadsheets with expiration dates, CME needs, and health records.\nI personally also have supplemental Word documents with a list of my hospital affiliations, privileges, contacts, and of course, my residences for the last decade.\nWorking locum tenens directly out of residency can be exciting and intimidating, but I will forever stand by the professional and personal worth I have found in it.\nWhile the list goes on and on of things that you can learn or need to know, hopefully this starts off the ResiGrad on the right path to success as a locum tenens.\nTool: Gathering your documents 5 ways to prepare for locum tenens jobs while still in residency Jul 03, 2024 The pros and cons of working locum tenens right out of residency Jun 07, 2024 What I wish I had known coming out of residency Jun 06, 2024 Categories Benefits of locum tenens Compensation & taxes Early career International locum tenens Late career Locums for NPs Locums for PAs Locums how-to Provider perspectives"

    "content": "Tricks of the trade: 7 tips to enhance your locums experience May 20, 2022 7 Min Read Dr.\nRK Devlin RK Devlin, MD, FIDSA, shares her advice on what physicians can do to ensure a locum tenens assignment is a positive experience from start to finish.\nAs an infectious diseases locum provider, I worked continuously for two years at three lengthy hospital assignments away from home.\nThis was during the pandemic, so the jobs and the travel were challenging, and it became increasingly important for me to find ways to make my locum tenens experience more positive and comfortable.\nBy doing these seven things, I was able to have some much-needed respite.\nWhile we all have our self-care rituals while on assignment, I hope these tips will help you stay happy and healthy during your locums assignments.\nThe story of locum tenens 1.\nCommunicate your preferences The first step to ensuring a positive locum tenens experience is to clearly communicate your practice and travel preferences to your recruiter.\nBeing honest about the type and amount of work you want to do is imperative, as those choices allow your recruiter to match you with a job opportunity that best meets your expectations.\nMy assignment preference is to work on an inpatient infectious disease consultative service at a smaller community-based teaching institution.\nI’ve let my recruiter know this in advance, so this way I know what to expect when I arrive at my assignment.\nI’ve also communicated that I don’t like working more than seven days in a row, more than two weeks a month, or more than three to six months total.\nAnd I have no interest in overtime.\nFor me, a manageable consult burden and patient census that gets me home in time for dinner is more important to me than money.\n2.\nUpgrade, upgrade, upgrade Traveling for locums work can be stressful, to be sure.\nThis was particularly true during the pandemic when flights were cancelled and delayed.\nFood options were limited — I ate more convenience store and vending machine meals than I’d like to admit — and nearly all hotel services, like bars, restaurants, pools, and gyms, were closed.\nYou can’t overcome all of the burdens that come with travel, but you can certainly find ways to make your trips more tolerable.\nI recommend paying with a travel credit card that offers airline club access and take advantage of deals at airport bars, restaurants, and stores.\nUse your airline miles to upgrade to first class for extra space and leg room, a quieter cabin, and first on/first off boarding on cross-country flights.\nIt’s worth every mile you use, in my opinion.\nAlways ask for a hotel room upgrade; you’d be surprised at how often you can get one.\nAnd use the perks that come with hotel loyalty programs and branded credit cards, including free nights, free food and drinks, and special club or lounge access.\nIf you have room preferences, tell the reservation desk exactly what you want.\nThey can accommodate for your preferences, like if you want a high or low floor, near or far from the elevator, king bed or two queens.\nRequest several bottles of water and extra coffee supplies at the time of check-in.\nI also want my room to have a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee machine — I’ll ask to be moved if I’m given a room without them.\n3.\nPack what you can’t do without Everybody has a few packable items that can evoke the comforts of home — they are absolutely worth the space in your suitcase.\nI hate hotel toiletries, so I bring my own shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.\nI always travel with a pair of my favorite slippers and several pouches of my best hydrating face mask.\nAnd, I don’t go anywhere without a jar of my favorite instant espresso, individual packages of Kikkoman soy sauce and Cholula hot sauce, and a container of Maldon salt flakes.\n4.\nEat your fruits and veggies Eating at local restaurants is part of the joy of traveling, but portions are big (and high in calories), leftovers don’t keep well, and mealtimes can be unpredictable.\nIt is also hard to stick with the salad section on the menu when regional delicacies are on offer.\nI recommend finding a grocery store as soon as you arrive for your assignment in a new town.\nHotel refrigerators are tiny, but they can usually handle pints of fresh berries, spinach in a bag, a package of raw vegetables with dip, hummus with pita chips, or fruit/vegetable smoothies in a bottle.\nIf you can at least start the day with a healthy breakfast or add a serving of fruit or vegetables to your nighttime snack, you’ll feel less guilty about those indulgent restaurant meals.\n5.\nHave an open mind and a curious nature I’ve often been asked if working away from home at new institutions is stressful.\nWhile there is always a bit of anxiety when navigating a new environment, I mostly find locums work to be both interesting and educational.\nBecause a locum provider is usually filling a much-needed gap in coverage, I’ve found that new colleagues are usually more accepting of my temporary presence than I anticipated.\nIf you’re willing to ask, they’ll lend a hand when you’re struggling with directions, protocols, or the EMR.\nI like learning about patient care in different medical settings and establishing new friendships.\nAnd if you’re lucky, your new colleagues will invite you to dinner, include you in holiday parties, or join you at local events.\n6.\nKeep to your routine For me, one of the biggest stressors in medicine is the lack of control over my day.\nEven if the morning starts with a manageable patient census, there is no way to predict how many new consults, curbsides, provider phone calls, resident questions, staff interruptions, or procedural delays will influence your work hours or your stress levels.\nFortunately, though, you can develop a routine that reinforces your self-discipline, even during locums assignments.\nFor some, this might include breakfast at the hotel, a full day of responsibilities without lunch at work, an evening exercise session at a local gym, and an on-demand movie at night.\nFor others (like me), it means grabbing a double shot latte at a local coffee shop on the way to work, arriving early enough for computer rounds before seeing patients, stopping for lunch at midday for a much-needed mental and physical boost, and reading a new book by a local author before bed.\n7.\nExplore when you can Every locums assignment allows opportunities for experiencing a new landscape, sampling regional food specialties, and visiting attractions reflective of local culture.\nIt can be hard to explore after work if days are long, so I either arrive early or stay a few days after my locums work week is done; this allows for some extended personal travel in the area.\nI’ve also driven — rather than flown — to reach an assignment, which resulted in a fantastic one-way road trip across the country.\nI try to visit an independent bookstore in every new community.\nI can usually get great recommendations from the staff for nearby bars and restaurants after I’ve bought a book to read.\nAnd, I make it a rule to visit at least one regional art museum in the area — I’ve never failed to be amazed by the impressive pieces found in the most unexpected places.\nI’ve found museum gift shops are the best places to find cool souvenirs for the folks back home.\nAs long as I follow these seven tips while on assignment, I’m sure to feel like I’m in my home away from home.\nI’m guaranteed to have a positive locum tenens experience, every time.\nMore locums resources Tricks of the trade: 7 tips to enhance your locums experience May 20, 2022 How locums has helped me stay fresh and challenged by medicine Jun 02, 2022 How to prepare for a locums assignment Jun 30, 2022 Categories Benefits of locum tenens Compensation & taxes Early career International locum tenens Late career Locums for NPs Locums for PAs Locums how-to Provider perspectives"

    "content": "How to prepare for a locums assignment Jun 30, 2022 7 Min Read Dr.\nNicholas Kusnezov Nicholas Kusnezov, MD, shares his tips on what to do to prepare for a locum tenens assignment.\nWhen it comes to getting ready for an assignment, there are a few important considerations that are essential to ensuring a seamless start to your locum tenens assignment.\nBefore you arrive First and foremost, communication is paramount.\nMake sure to establish a direct line of communication with the hospital coordinator for your assignment.\nHaving a primary point of contact at the hospital avoids the potential for valuable information to be dropped or miscommunicated by third parties.\nThe coordinator can help you with whatever training is needed and forward any important documents that may need to be completed prior to starting.\nSome training will unavoidably require you to be on-site and in-person, but there will be the occasional online trainings ( HIPAA for instance) that you will be able to complete remotely and thereby avoid delays or issues with credentialing and starting on time.\nFor your first assignment at a new location, if possible, arrive early that day or the day prior in order to get set up before you start call or clinic.\nAlthough you’re typically allotted a day to settle in, you may start on a weekend or a holiday, necessitating special arrangements for your orientation.\nMake sure that you lock down the day and time for orientation to avoid an unnecessarily cumbersome start.\nVerify your schedule Always verify that your schedules match prior to arrival.\nThere are a number of middle-men involved in this process and, as a result, it is not uncommon for assignment dates to be erroneously changed or dropped between you, the locum company, and the institution — and the latter two often have multiple agents involved in the process.\nIn my experience, this invariably will happen at some point.\nI would recommend verifying the date and time that you are scheduled to start and finish your assignment each time you make travel arrangements, regardless of how many times you have worked at the given institution.\nAdditionally, I would be sure to obtain and verify a point of contact with whom to receive and to give sign-out for the given block of dates.\nThis ensures continuity and the best possible patient care.\nSEE ALSO: 5 tips for success in locum tenens A good first impression From a professional standpoint, always dress to impress.\nRegardless of how casual your conversations may be with the hospital coordinator or hospital faculty, err on the side of dressing professionally.\nFirst impressions are paramount and will often set the tone for your time at that assignment.\nI would recommend business attire for the first day — after which the expectations and policy of the facility or clinic, hospital, and OR attire can be established.\nYou will never be knocked for overdressing, but you will hear stories of predecessors arriving underdressed, in scrubs, sweat clothes, etc.\nDon’t be that story.\nYou are a reflection of the institution.\nAlign on goals and capabilities Lastly, make sure you and the institution discuss your goals for the assignment.\nFor instance, a hospital may be interested in increasing their total joint arthroplasty volume, while you are instead looking to do chiefly hand cases.\nIt’s important that these goals are elucidated and ideal if they are comparable or at least reconcilable.\nIt may be that your initial goals are beyond the capabilities of the hospital as it stands, but a better understanding of these goals may drive hospital-based improvements and facilitate this for future assignments there.\nYou will find that physicians have an enormous capacity to facilitate positive changes in hospital efficiency, capabilities, and patient care.\nWork to understand and clarify the capabilities of the hospital and how that system specifically works.\nFor instance, this may involve verifying what severity of trauma and degree of patient comorbidities the institution is comfortable dealing with, both operatively and post-operatively.\nAdditionally, weekend staffing and capabilities should be elucidated ahead of time.\nIt is important to eliminate ambiguity prior to starting so you aren’t overwhelmed with situations well beyond what you expected and, vice versa, so you don’t overwhelm the system with situations beyond which the hospital is capable of handling.\nWith these considerations in mind, you should be more than prepared for your assignment and to give the best impression possible.\nThis article first appeared on WeatherbyHealthcare.com .\nReprinted with permission.\nMore locums resources Tricks of the trade: 7 tips to enhance

    "content": "The opportunity of a lifetime working international locum tenens Dec 14, 2018 7 Min Read Jen Hunter Feel like dipping your toes in the clear, aquamarine waters in the Caribbean? Want to experience all the outdoor adventures New Zealand has to offer, and enjoy these experiences with your family? Do you have the inclination to work with underserved populations in rural Australia? Or bring your knowledge and expertise to the United Arab Emirates? International locums makes all these a possibility.\nMost associate locum tenens assignments as being something only available in the U.S.\nThe opportunities are much broader, however, with opportunities in most specialties in locales as diverse as Guam, the outback of Australia, the Caribbean islands, China or Canada.\nAs with any locums assignment, there are pros and cons, upsides and downsides.\nAs one can imagine, there’s more paperwork involved with working internationally.\nAnother consideration is length of assignments.\nThe expectation with international locums assignments is anywhere from a month to one year, or longer if the locums physician chooses to extend the assignment.\nIn comparison, domestic locums assignments can be just a few shifts, so international locums physicians may have a much longer commitment.\nHowever, there are some U.S.\nterritories in the Caribbean and Pacific islands that offer shorter term jobs.\nSome, like Dr.\nTara Piech, started working international locum tenens as a means to live in New Zealand permanently.\nShe said there were many draws for her and her husband: “the weather, nature, the relaxed lifestyle, sensible political climate, and the universal medical care.” As soon as she retired from the military, she took an assignment in New Zealand, and from then on they made it their home.\nAt the outset of her assignment, Dr.\nPiech had a bit of professional culture shock.\nShe initially was taken aback that family medicine doctors in New Zealand couldn’t order tests like MRIs or CT scans without specialist approval, but after a while working within the New Zealand healthcare system became second nature.\nOne hiccup? “We wanted to bring our three dogs.\nThe hardest part of working international locums for me was working out how they could be with us, which ended up being costly and logistically difficult.” Working internationally may be the cure for physician burnout International locums jobs can also be a great opportunity to recharge your life and career.\nOur latest physician workload survey found 40 percent of physicians say their job satisfaction suffers because of burnout, and 53 percent have considered leaving their profession altogether.\nInternational locums may be the cure.\nSome physicians liken working international locum tenens to a working sabbatical.\nIt’s a chance to both learn and teach.\nDepending on the area and healthcare system, a physician from the U.S.\nwould be bringing first-world medicine to some locations without that luxury, giving the locum exposure to different ways to practice medicine in varying settings.\nAt the same time, locums physicians in rural or less-than-first-world facilities will need to call upon their basic diagnostic skills rather than rely on a CT scan or other technology.\nWorking international locums does come with some hurdles.\nFor example, doctors in Australia earn a similar salary to doctors practicing in the U.S.\nbut other international locations may not have the same compensation that U.S.\nphysicians are used to.\nDr.\nSean Ryan and Dr.\nDoug Smith , however, both report that this wasn’t a deterrent, because they were able to provide much-needed coverage all while exploring that part of the world.\nAlso, airfare, housing, and a car are typically covered while on assignment.\nWorking international locums for an unforgettable experience Dr.\nRyan and his wife saw working international locums as an opportunity to explore other parts of the world – while making money – before their daughter began school.\n“We’ve been on other trips, and we don’t remember them because we packed so much in the short time we had,” he said.\n“But when you live somewhere for nine or 12 months, you get to know the people and the place.” And since there are usually generous paid vacation days, they followed the advice of a New Zealand native colleague and traveled extensively: “We visited the Cook Islands, Fiji, and Bali,” Dr.\nRyan recalls.\nDr.\nRyan and his wife take the time he’s not working to explore and “live like the locals.” He and his wife also note the importance of seeking out ways to become part of the community, especially since assignments are typically three months and longer.\n“Don’t hesitate to push yourself into the culture and meeting people.” Dr.\nJason Lambrese worked in New Zealand right out of residency and found that the ability to travel on the weekends meant he saw a lot more of the world on his assignment than he was expecting.\nHe said this about his experience: “I love that I didn’t have to work the weekends and could travel.\nBy the end we were traveling every weekend.\nWe were looking for the cheap fares.\nI got to see and do a lot.\nWe could put the real life stuff on hold because there really wasn’t much real life stuff to do out there except work and pay a few bills and that was it.\nI had that freedom to adventure and to explore a lot more than I give myself time to do here (in the U.S.)” All in the family – with a little bit of paperwork One consideration both Dr.\nRyan and Dr.\nSmith mention is to pre-plan what spouses will do while they’re on assignment.\nDo they want to work? Take the time to travel in their free time? As you can imagine, the rules for a lengthy stay vary from country to country, so do your research.\nAnd seek the help of professionals who specialize in international locums.\nThey can also help with securing visas, a sometimes daunting process.\nMany international locations will take physicians right out of residency but some may have requirements for board certification or other post-graduate training and experience.\nDoctors who attended a medical school listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools can qualify for work in, for example, Australia and New Zealand.\nDr.\nRyan’s wife Indira was planning to work as a speech language therapist, but they discovered that securing the necessary certifications and licenses was too onerous.\nInstead, she decided to volunteer with an Australian program helping immigrants improve their English.\nDr.\nSmith’s wife Barb chose to use her time to volunteer and explore the surrounding areas.\n“I didn’t want a job because Doug only worked four days a week, and we wanted the flexibility so we could travel when he wasn’t on duty,” she shares.\nPlanning, preparation, and a taste for adventure The key to working international locum tenens is to do your research.\nReach out to experienced professionals who can help to arrange and secure the necessary paperwork and certifications.\nConsiderations such as living in a unique culture with different practice settings, treatment modalities, and housing should be accounted for, and, of course, ready yourself for an adventure you will remember forever.\nGet more resources for locums For more information on international locum tenens assignments check out Global Medical Staffing's locums 101 guide .\nCategories Benefits of locum tenens Compensation & taxes Early career International locum tenens Late career Locums for NPs Locums for PAs Locums how-to Provider perspectives"

    "content": "A physician's guide to locum tenens taxes Jan 10, 2024 7 Min Read Jen Hunter Nearly 7% of the U.S.\nworkforce is made up of independent contractors , which includes locum tenens physicians.\nInstead of automatic deductions for Social Security, federal and state income taxes, FICA, and Medicare, taxes work differently for independent contractors.\nThis guide will help you understand how to plan for, prepare, and manage locum tenens taxes.\nLearn more about locums Employee vs.\nindependent contractor Locum tenens physicians, by definition, are independent contractors.\nThey do not receive benefits or get automatic deductions from the facility in which they work or from the locums agency they’re working for.\nInstead of receiving a W-2 with automatic deductions at the end of the year, they will receive a 1099-MISC from each business client, which simply reports income earned.\nThere are no automatic deductions on a 1099-MISC.\nThis is where a tax professional can help.\nOne physician's take : The financial side of locums: What’s your strategy? The top 5 locum tenens tax considerations Although the taxes are the least fun part of working locum tenens, don’t let this be a deterrent.\nOnce you have a good system in place, it’s not any harder to take care of your taxes than it would be for any small business owner.\nOf course, finding a reputable tax professional with experience in locum tenens physicians’ finances is worth every penny, because they will help you develop a good system.\nAccording to Alexis Gallati of Cerebral Tax Advisors , here are the top 5 things to remember: You must give your agency your Form W-9 before beginning your first assignment.\nYou have to pay income tax on income you earn as you earn.\nFor W-2 employees, this is done on their behalf each paycheck.\nAs a 1099 employee, you must make quarterly estimated tax payments .\nQuarterly estimated tax payments must be made on time to avoid penalties.\nThey are generally due on the 15 th of April, June, September, and January.\nThe amount of estimated tax you need to pay depends mostly on your prior year’s taxable income and credits.\nYou may need to pay as little as 90% of last year’s tax liability, but as high as 100%.\nFailure to do the above will result in an estimated tax penalty , which is 0.5% of the amount unpaid for each month the tax isn’t paid.\nTracking and reporting expenses as a locum physician Gallati says the most common mistake independent contractors make is not keeping track of their expenses or their income.\nThat’s why it’s important to keep receipts for everything from the time you leave your home for an assignment to the time you come back — and possibly in between.\nAnother must? Keep the actual receipts or a copy; the IRS won’t accept bank or credit card statements.\n“It can be as easy as setting up a Google Drive or a cloud-based system; you don’t have to have the physical receipts, just a picture or digital image will work,” she says.\n“Additionally, be aware of those things your agency is covering, like travel, meals, and incidentals , and make sure you’re not writing off expenses that are being reimbursed by the agency.” Whether you have a per diem expense allowance is dependent primarily upon: The length of assignment .\nIf your assignment is longer than one year, this allowance doesn’t apply.\nBut if your assignment lasts one year or less, your employment is treated as temporary.\n“The term of assignment should be for a definite period of time and documented,” Gallati says.\n“If the assignment is reasonably expected to last for one year or less, but it’s later discovered that employment is expected to exceed one year, the employment will be treated as temporary until the date the expectation changes.” The distance from your permanent residence.\nIt must be 50 miles or greater, generally with overnight stays.\nBe sure to discuss with your tax professional whether actual expenses or a per diem applies.\nYou’ll want to be sure to get credit for all of the work-related expenses you are eligible for.\nWhat's the difference? How locums jobs and perm jobs compare Locum tenens physician tax deductions Another nice aspect of being an independent contractor is that it is far easier to take business-related tax deductions.\nAnything you spend on your business — including scrubs, white coats, shoes, computers, phones, CME materials, licensing fees, subscriptions, mileage , and more — can be placed directly on Schedule C (assuming sole proprietorship, but the process is similar for partnerships and corporations) as a business expense.\nThese expenses are deducted from the business income before any taxes, including payroll taxes, and you are paid on that income.\nIt is super easy.\nLEARN MORE: 7 tax benefits of being an independent contractor How to choose a business entity There are many options for setting up a business entity when beginning work as an independent contractor.\nDepending on your situation, it may make more sense just to file as self-employed without creating a formal business entity.\nIf your situation merits the creation of a business or tax entity, two of the most popular for locums physicians are LLCs and S corporations .\nThere are two crucial differences between an LLC and an S Corp: an LLC is a business structure legally separating the business and the individual, and an S Corp is an election that indicates how the business (physician) is taxed.\nThe benefit of both is you can protect your personal assets from creditors of your business.\nHowever, this does not include protection from a malpractice lawsuit.\nIf you’re working with an accredited locum tenens agency, though, they’ll typically offer comprehensive malpractice coverage .\nEmergency medicine physician Dr.\nJim Mock chose to create an S corp.\nHe’s found for him, there are tax advantages.\nHe pays himself a monthly base salary, and if he exceeds his base salary he does a shareholder distribution that’s taxed a little differently than his base salary.\n“Of course, I coordinate all of that with my accountant to be within federal regulations and tax laws,” he says.\nPensions, SEPs, and savings for 1099 physicians As an independent contractor, you will be responsible for creating your nest egg for retirement.\nDr.\nMock — with the help of his accountant — has a solid plan in place to prepare for his future retirement.\n“I have a two-part pension plan: a money purchase pension plan and a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan,” he says.\n“The SEP allows me to be able to fund maximally every year, to be prepared.\nOn top of that, I have a college savings plan where I can save a certain amount but it’s tax-free and then some.\nBeyond that, I’m taxed at a lower rate.” Gallati recommends the Solo 401(k) over the SEP IRA because with a Solo 401(k) you can put in the maximum employee amount of $22,500 (or $30,000 if you 50 or older), whereas with an SEP IRA, you’re limited to 25% of your compensation into a retirement account.\nBoth have maximum contributions of $66,000 (as of 2024).\nWhen it comes to looking at retirement accounts that you want to set up, Gallati says you may want to consider setting up an S Corp or PLLC that will allow you to maximize your ability to make retirement contributions.\n“There’s a new 199A or QBI deduction (one and the same), and most independent contractors are making over that $315,000 (or up to $415,000 if married filing jointly) max income to take advantage of that deduction.\nA retirement deduction can help lower your income,” she says.\nHave a tax plan before you start working locums After nearly 30 years in private practice, family medicine physician Dr.\nMarye McCroskey was ready to try something different.\nShe decided to try her hand at locum tenens, but she and her husband didn’t jump into it without some pre-planning.\n“I’d highly recommend getting an experienced accountant,” she says.\n“It’s important to be aware that each state has its own tax code.\nAt the moment, I’ve got income from several different contracts, and it’s easier to have someone who specializes in physician taxes.” The tax benefits can outweigh the burden for locum physicians Locum tenens work brings many physicians the work/life balance they’re craving.\nAlthough this lifestyle can mean a little more administrative work, it’s worth the increased freedom, schedule flexibility, and opportunity for career growth.\nWith a little help from a qualified tax professional, locum tenens taxes can be an easily managed part of a fulfilling career as a locum physician.\nHow to start your locums journey A physician's guide to locum tenens taxes Jan 10, 2024 7 physician tax deductions for locum tenens doctors Jan 18, 2024 2024 locum tenens pay trends: What specialties are up or down?

Staffing Agencies Licensing & Credentialing The agency trifecta: licensing, credentialing, privileging.\nLocums assignments can free you from some of the bureaucracy found in full-time positions.\nThat said, there is paperwork you’ll need to finish before accepting an assignment.\nThis is another area where established agencies can be a huge help.\nNALTO member agencies must follow strict credentialing guidelines you can see here .\nLarger agencies also have specialized teams that help you in every step of the process, including the benefits of their long-standing relationships with state licensing boards.\nJobs Available The partnerships that partner you with better jobs.\nCompHealth created locum tenens back in 1979 to deliver healthcare to underserved communities.\nWith its efficiencies and ability to quickly place medical professionals in unfilled positions, locums exploded from there.\nThe leading staffing agencies partner with the top healthcare systems, state medical agencies, and medical facilities across the nation for locums jobs, which means they have access to opportunities you can’t find on your own.\nLocations Stay close to home or travel to new places.\nDid you know that 51% of physicians who have worked locum tenens have taken an assignment locally (close to their home residence)? Providers have the option to take assignments close to home, travel to new places, or do a combination of both.\nTalk about endless opportunities.\nLooking to go global?

    "content": "A physician's guide to locum tenens taxes Jan 10, 2024 7 Min Read Jen Hunter Nearly 7% of the U.S.\nworkforce is made up of independent contractors , which includes locum tenens physicians.\nInstead of automatic deductions for Social Security, federal and state income taxes, FICA, and Medicare, taxes work differently for independent contractors.\nThis guide will help you understand how to plan for, prepare, and manage locum tenens taxes.\nLearn more about locums Employee vs.\nindependent contractor Locum tenens physicians, by definition, are independent contractors.\nThey do not receive benefits or get automatic deductions from the facility in which they work or from the locums agency they’re working for.\nInstead of receiving a W-2 with automatic deductions at the end of the year, they will receive a 1099-MISC from each business client, which simply reports income earned.\nThere are no automatic deductions on a 1099-MISC.\nThis is where a tax professional can help.\nOne physician's take : The financial side of locums: What’s your strategy? The top 5 locum tenens tax considerations Although the taxes are the least fun part of working locum tenens, don’t let this be a deterrent.\nOnce you have a good system in place, it’s not any harder to take care of your taxes than it would be for any small business owner.\nOf course, finding a reputable tax professional with experience in locum tenens physicians’ finances is worth every penny, because they will help you develop a good system.\nAccording to Alexis Gallati of Cerebral Tax Advisors , here are the top 5 things to remember: You must give your agency your Form W-9 before beginning your first assignment.\nYou have to pay income tax on income you earn as you earn.\nFor W-2 employees, this is done on their behalf each paycheck.\nAs a 1099 employee, you must make quarterly estimated tax payments .\nQuarterly estimated tax payments must be made on time to avoid penalties.\nThey are generally due on the 15 th of April, June, September, and January.\nThe amount of estimated tax you need to pay depends mostly on your prior year’s taxable income and credits.\nYou may need to pay as little as 90% of last year’s tax liability, but as high as 100%.\nFailure to do the above will result in an estimated tax penalty , which is 0.5% of the amount unpaid for each month the tax isn’t paid.\nTracking and reporting expenses as a locum physician Gallati says the most common mistake independent contractors make is not keeping track of their expenses or their income.\nThat’s why it’s important to keep receipts for everything from the time you leave your home for an assignment to the time you come back — and possibly in between.\nAnother must? Keep the actual receipts or a copy; the IRS won’t accept bank or credit card statements.\n“It can be as easy as setting up a Google Drive or a cloud-based system; you don’t have to have the physical receipts, just a picture or digital image will work,” she says.\n“Additionally, be aware of those things your agency is covering, like travel, meals, and incidentals , and make sure you’re not writing off expenses that are being reimbursed by the agency.” Whether you have a per diem expense allowance is dependent primarily upon: The length of assignment .\nIf your assignment is longer than one year, this allowance doesn’t apply.\nBut if your assignment lasts one year or less, your employment is treated as temporary.\n“The term of assignment should be for a definite period of time and documented,” Gallati says.\n“If the assignment is reasonably expected to last for one year or less, but it’s later discovered that employment is expected to exceed one year, the employment will be treated as temporary until the date the expectation changes.” The distance from your permanent residence.\nIt must be 50 miles or greater, generally with overnight stays.\nBe sure to discuss with your tax professional whether actual expenses or a per diem applies.\nYou’ll want to be sure to get credit for all of the work-related expenses you are eligible for.\nWhat's the difference? How locums jobs and perm jobs compare Locum tenens physician tax deductions Another nice aspect of being an independent contractor is that it is far easier to take business-related tax deductions.\nAnything you spend on your business — including scrubs, white coats, shoes, computers, phones, CME materials, licensing fees, subscriptions, mileage , and more — can be placed directly on Schedule C (assuming sole proprietorship, but the process is similar for partnerships and corporations) as a business expense.\nThese expenses are deducted from the business income before any taxes, including payroll taxes, and you are paid on that income.\nIt is super easy.\nLEARN MORE: 7 tax benefits of being an independent contractor How to choose a business entity There are many options for setting up a business entity when beginning work as an independent contractor.\nDepending on your situation, it may make more sense just to file as self-employed without creating a formal business entity.\nIf your situation merits the creation of a business or tax entity, two of the most popular for locums physicians are LLCs and S corporations .\nThere are two crucial differences between an LLC and an S Corp: an LLC is a business structure legally separating the business and the individual, and an S Corp is an election that indicates how the business (physician) is taxed.\nThe benefit of both is you can protect your personal assets from creditors of your business.\nHowever, this does not include protection from a malpractice lawsuit.\nIf you’re working with an accredited locum tenens agency, though, they’ll typically offer comprehensive malpractice coverage .\nEmergency medicine physician Dr.\nJim Mock chose to create an S corp.\nHe’s found for him, there are tax advantages.\nHe pays himself a monthly base salary, and if he exceeds his base salary he does a shareholder distribution that’s taxed a little differently than his base salary.\n“Of course, I coordinate all of that with my accountant to be within federal regulations and tax laws,” he says.\nPensions, SEPs, and savings for 1099 physicians As an independent contractor, you will be responsible for creating your nest egg for retirement.\nDr.\nMock — with the help of his accountant — has a solid plan in place to prepare for his future retirement.\n“I have a two-part pension plan: a money purchase pension plan and a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan,” he says.\n“The SEP allows me to be able to fund maximally every year, to be prepared.\nOn top of that, I have a college savings plan where I can save a certain amount but it’s tax-free and then some.\nBeyond that, I’m taxed at a lower rate.” Gallati recommends the Solo 401(k) over the SEP IRA because with a Solo 401(k) you can put in the maximum employee amount of $22,500 (or $30,000 if you 50 or older), whereas with an SEP IRA, you’re limited to 25% of your compensation into a retirement account.\nBoth have maximum contributions of $66,000 (as of 2024).\nWhen it comes to looking at retirement accounts that you want to set up, Gallati says you may want to consider setting up an S Corp or PLLC that will allow you to maximize your ability to make retirement contributions.\n“There’s a new 199A or QBI deduction (one and the same), and most independent contractors are making over that $315,000 (or up to $415,000 if married filing jointly) max income to take advantage of that deduction.\nA retirement deduction can help lower your income,” she says.\nHave a tax plan before you start working locums After nearly 30 years in private practice, family medicine physician Dr.\nMarye McCroskey was ready to try something different.\nShe decided to try her hand at locum tenens, but she and her husband didn’t jump into it without some pre-planning.\n“I’d highly recommend getting an experienced accountant,” she says.\n“It’s important to be aware that each state has its own tax code.\nAt the moment, I’ve got income from several different contracts, and it’s easier to have someone who specializes in physician taxes.” The tax benefits can outweigh the burden for locum physicians Locum tenens work brings many physicians the work/life balance they’re craving.\nAlthough this lifestyle can mean a little more administrative work, it’s worth the increased freedom, schedule flexibility, and opportunity for career growth.\nWith a little help from a qualified tax professional, locum tenens taxes can be an easily managed part of a fulfilling career as a locum physician.\nHow to start your locums journey A physician's guide to locum tenens taxes Jan 10, 2024 7 physician tax deductions for locum tenens doctors Jan 18, 2024 2024 locum tenens pay trends: What specialties are up or down?

    "content": "4 physicians find the work/life balance they were searching for May 01, 2019 7 Min Read Jen Hunter Medical missions.\nHomeschooling.\nTraveling the world.\nFinding your Zen.\nWorking locum tenens has made all of this possible for these four physicians, all while still doing what they love: practice medicine.\nIt’s no secret that it takes many years, hard work, and a lot of money to earn a medical degree, the culmination of the pursuit of a long-held dream of caring for patients.\nIt’s also true that the hours a physician dedicates to their profession once they become a doctor can be significant, which can lead to burnout.\nIn a recent locumstory.com physician workload survey , 40 percent of doctors reported that their job satisfaction suffers when they’re feeling overworked, and a majority of physicians (81 percent) reported a lack of balance as their primary stressor in life.\nThe solution to achieving a better work/life balance? For these four physicians it was working locum tenens.\nHaving the time to homeschool – and sleep well Locum tenens physician Dr.\nPeter Kim says he didn’t even realize how out of balance his life was until he had his first good-night’s sleep after working locum tenens.\n“I find I sleep better, which I never realized how heavily things were weighing on me,” he says.\n“So I’ve been sleeping great.” Dr.\nKim also found locum tenens has allowed him the time and ability to homeschool his oldest child.\nAs part of his schooling, Dr.\nKim wanted his son to experience the world to learn about other countries and cultures.\nHis son chose London.\n“I was able to take him to London for a little over a week and explore without having to worry about what would be waiting for me at the office,” he recalls, “or having to plan six months in advance.” “That’s been one of the great things — just being able to juggle family time.” Attaining Zen After many long days, weekends, and traffic, Dr.\nAmy Wecker was feeling burnt out, so as a long-time practitioner of yoga , she decided it was time to re-center herself.\n“I went on a yoga retreat in Peru, where I came to the realization that my schedule was unsustainable,” she says.\nWhen she returned home, she began googling locums agencies.\nOnce she began working locums, there was no going back.\n“I have never in my whole life had the free time the way I’ve had these past two-and-a-half months,” she says.\n“Even the days I work aren’t like the days I used to work.\nI have time to do yoga, clean my apartment, go to the dentist.” Bureaucracy and its impact on work/life balance The physician workload survey also found that many doctors struggle with the administrative burdens that take them away from patient care.\n69 percent of physicians surveyed reported that too much time dealing with bureaucracy and administrative paperwork was the top reason they had considered quitting medicine prior to retirement age.\nAnd in a recent physician happiness survey conducted by American Academy of Family Physicians in partnership with CompHealth, nearly three-quarters of physicians reported clerical burdens as being a reason for unhappiness on the job.\nNot anymore for Dr.\nNoel Lumpkin .\nShe’s found since working locum tenens, she has achieved the work/life balance she’s always wanted, finally feeling freed from the bureaucracy and excessive workload she so often encountered.\n“I haven’t been to a meeting in 11 years,” she says.\n“There are no after-hours meetings, no callback.\nMy free time is my own.” Establishing a nonprofit that spreads kindness and technology Dr.\nLarry Daugherty doesn't work locums himself, instead he brings locums in to cover for him when he's devoting time to Radiating Hope , a nonprofit he co-founded with the goal of bringing radiation oncology to underserved parts of the world.\nTo raise money to support their efforts, Dr.\nDaugherty and his partner lead mountain climbing expeditions , with a portion of the money generated going toward their nonprofit.\nIn addition, Radiating Hope works with facilities to donate their outdated radiation oncology equipment to places in the world that would otherwise not have access to this life-saving equipment.\nDr.\nDaugherty puts much of his efforts to education and treatment in Africa, where the capabilities for treating cancer are limited.\n“If a woman has a mass in her breast, she may not even think of the word cancer,” he explains.\n“In some tribes there’s almost a curse or a taboo associated with it, and they’ll be isolated.\nThere are education problems, technology problems.” “I wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to help people, and now I’ve found a way to do enormous good with very small changes,” he says.\nThe ability to rediscover life’s balance with locum tenens So whether your passion is climbing Everest, practicing yoga asana, or traveling to London with your son, locum tenens can give you the time, freedom, and flexibility for the work/life balance you’ve been craving.\nHow locum tenens was the ideal path straight out of residency Jun 08, 2024 From locums right out of residency to teaching residents Jun 28, 2024 Freebies and discounts for physicians and advanced practice providers: Winter 2022-23 edition Nov 28, 2022 Categories Benefits of locum tenens Compensation & taxes Early career International locum tenens Late career Locums for NPs Locums for PAs Locums how-to Provider perspectives"

    "content": "How locum tenens was the ideal path straight out of residency Jun 08, 2024 7 Min Read Jen Hunter Locum tenens gives physicians many things: work/life balance, fewer administrative hassles, extra income , professional independence, and the freedom and flexibility to do humanitarian work.\nFor family medicine physician Dr.\nStanley Green, locum tenens ticks all those boxes.\nHe says he was lucky to discover what locum tenens could do for him right out of residency, and he’s worked locums exclusively since his graduation in 2016.\n“This is a model I’m seeing more and more,” Dr.\nGreen says.\n“More folks who are straight out of residency are starting out as locums.” Though Dr.\nGreen is a locum tenens physician, at the moment he works exclusively at a hospital in Pittsburgh .\nAfter his first assignment there, he was asked to extend his assignment.\nDr.\nGreen has also taken assignments in a couple of hospitals in the Dayton, Ohio , area.\nOne assignment was at a rural hospital and another in downtown Dayton.\n“I had rotated though West Penn Hospital [his current assignment] while I was in medical school, so I was familiar with it,” he says.\n“I really enjoyed that hospital, so when I heard of the opportunity I took it.” The freedom to focus on patient care He’s found that the money he’d earn in a permanent position doesn’t compare to what he earns working locums.\nHe said he earns 25-35% more working locums than what he’d earn in a hospital system.\nThe other benefits? “While my other colleagues are burdened with scheduling issues, staff meetings, and other administrative hassles, I’m able to give all my attention to the patient,” Dr.\nGreen says.\nThe freedom to focus on patient care rather than attend extra meetings, deal with hospital bureaucracy, and have extra trainings is something that his colleagues are envious of.\nHe’s found that he’s been a better advocate for his patients than he could be if he were on the payroll, and he can do so without simultaneously worrying about interoffice politics.\n“I think that makes me a better patient advocate because I know the only thing that really matters to me is the quality of patient care.” Making each patient feel “special” Rather than being put off by the fact that Dr.\nGreen isn’t a local, his patients aren’t the least bothered.\nHe’s even been told by some that it makes them feel special that he came all the way from Florida to take care of them.\n“It’s led to a bunch of interesting conversations,” he shares.\n“People feel like I take the time to listen, to talk to them.\nThey appreciate that even though I’m not a permanent member of the staff at the hospital, I can still provide the kind of care they would expect from their local hometown doc.” His patients are also a great source of suggestions for things to see and do when they hear he’s not a native.\nDr.\nGreen adds that with his seven days on, seven days off schedule as a locums, he’s able to focus solely on patient care while he’s on assignment.\nBut when he’s home in Florida, his wife gets his full attention since he’s not worrying about what’s happening at the hospital.\n“Since my schedule is pretty stable, I’m free to just hang out with my wife the entire week,” he says.\n“We end up doing a lot of traveling and hosting our friends who live in colder climates.” Humanitarian aspirations A South African by birth, Dr.\nGreen is determined to return to his home country someday and give back to the place he came from.\nWhile there’s a need for doctors in the U.S., he says there’s a more acute need in the KwaZulu-Natal Province that’s been particularly hard-hit by the AIDS epidemic .\nThere’s a hitch though.\n“The kind of money I’d make in South Africa would never enable me to pay off my student loans,” he says.\n“I’d basically be paying interest for the rest of my life.\nBut with the flexibility and money I earn working locums, I envision that I’ll stay with locums for some part of the year and live in both places, maybe working three to four months in the States.\nThen with the money I earn here I can facilitate living the rest of the year in South Africa and getting paid little or nothing.” Even his financial advisor recommended sticking with locums if he wants to pay off his student loans more quickly while doing the humanitarian work he’s planning to do in South Africa.\nAnswering other doctors' questions about locum tenens Being peppered by questions about locum tenens from colleagues just out of residency is commonplace, he says.\n“I frequently get asked about things pertaining to the logistics of working locum tenens,” Dr.\nGreen shares.\n“Things like ‘Do I have to pay for housing and car rental?’ – which is nothing – and of course what the pay and schedules are like.” Dr.\nGreen also gets a lot of questions about the assignment locations, since a lot of physicians seem to assume that locum tenens get sent to the least desirable locations.\n“They think you get sent to a trash pit somewhere in some dumpster-fire hospital, and you end up having to manage things under armpit conditions.\nI always say I’ve never had a situation that I felt overworked or where I thought I was in danger.” And what if physicians find themselves in these situations? “I tell them, ‘You don’t have to go back,’” he says.\n“My agency vets their hospital pretty thoroughly.” Locum tenens at the right time Dr.\nGreen couldn’t be happier that he was introduced to locum tenens right out of residency.\nIt’s given him the ability to create a schedule perfectly suited to his lifestyle, and it’ll eventually allow him to realize his ultimate goal of giving back in his native South Africa.\n“I really love my job, and I feel like every day there’s something that happens which reminds me of that.” Find if locums works for you Learn what residents think of locum tenens Emergency medicine residents share their perception of locum tenens: How locum tenens was the ideal path straight out of residency Jun 08, 2024 From locums right out of residency to teaching residents Jun 28, 2024 Freebies and discounts for physicians and advanced practice providers: Winter 2022-23 edition Nov 28, 2022 Categories Benefits of locum tenens Compensation & taxes Early career International locum tenens Late career Locums for NPs Locums for PAs Locums how-to Provider perspectives"

often there was nobody else for them to see.” Though it was a small facility in a small town, Dr.\nBui never felt like she was alone.\n“I was out of my comfort zone, and I learned so much,” she says.\n“There were things I’d never seen before, so I had to look it up or call a colleague.\nIt’s not like I was there on my own.\nWhen working locum tenens, there’s always someone you can call to ask for help.\nIt’s challenging; it was almost like being a resident again.” A reminder of why you went to med school Dr.\nBui has found that working locum tenens means practicing back-to-basics medicine, and not having to sacrifice patient time for time spent in meetings or on administrative work.\nShe loves that feeling of walking into a locums assignment and practicing back-to-basics medicine the way she pictured herself doing when studying for her board exams.\nShe said that’s her favorite part of working locum tenens.\n“I think the best thing for me is that I just get to be a doctor,” she says.\n“It’s nice to walk into a clinic where you know they need help, and you know you’re able to help.\nPeople are genuinely appreciative that you’re there, and on day one you’re always welcome because they need the help.\n“I just show up and be a good doctor.\nThat’s why I went to med school, right?” Life beyond locums When she’s not treating patients, Dr.\nBui still finds time to have fun.\nEvery weekend she plans a road trip to visit friends in the area or to engage in one of her favorite activities.\n“I’m a beach volleyball player and I sail, so I always try to find one of those two things,” she says.\n“On assignment in Denver I actually joined a beach volleyball team; they have indoor warehouses with beach sand.” Her advice for doctors interested in trying the locums lifestyle: “Keep your mind open to where you want to go.\nThe first place I ever went was a place I had never heard of before, and it was such a good experience because I met so many great people.\nBe flexible and don’t be afraid to do something that you’ve never done before.\nChallenge yourself to learn new things.” How locum tenens was the ideal path straight out of residency Jun 08, 2024 From locums right out of residency to teaching residents Jun 28, 2024 Freebies and discounts for physicians and advanced practice providers: Winter 2022-23 edition Nov 28, 2022 Categories Benefits of locum tenens Compensation & taxes Early career International locum tenens Late career Locums for NPs Locums for PAs Locums how-to Provider perspectives"

    "content": "Part-time locums with a full-time job: One PA's experience Dec 01, 2019 7 Min Read Jen Hunter Working locum tenens part-time on the side is a good fit for neurosurgery physician assistant Stacy Hicks.\nHe looks forward to the extra paycheck, he’s worked out how to keep in constant and meaningful contact with his family when he’s away, and he finds working in different settings to be rewarding.\nDiscovering a love of medicine early on Stacy’s path to becoming a PA began early and in a slightly unusual manner.\nWhen he was 14, he worked in a pharmacy.\nHe says he felt he’s always had a knack for medicine and looked forward to the times he’d be able to take blood pressures at the local hospital.\n“This got me really interested in medicine,” Stacy says.\n“Then not too much later, I joined the Air Force and became a flight medic , which seemed like a natural fit.\nI did that for six years before I went into nursing school.\nSix years after that, I decided to go to PA school.” A workaholic at heart, but family comes first Currently, Stacy is working a full-time job and picking up locum tenens shifts part time when he’s able to.\nHe’s committed to working locums at least one week a month, but since the facility where he’s working appreciates having him so much, he sometimes picks up extra days as well.\nWhen asked how he’s able to work a full-time job while working locums on the side, Stacy says he’s always had two jobs.\n“People always think I’m crazy for working that much,” he says.\n“But I enjoy work, so I don’t know what I’d do if I couldn’t do it.” Aside from the fact that he’s a self-described workaholic, he’s committed to staying fully connected to his wife and two small children at home.\nHis two-year-old and four-year-old sons love speaking to him on Facetime, and he uses this opportunity to read them books and wish them good night.\n“All of this traveling requires phone calls and Facetime.\nI’ll call them when I’m off shift at 7 a.m., nap for a bit, then call them midday,” Stacy shares.\n“That way I keep that connection — because sometimes my kids have a little breakdown when I’m not there from time to time.” But, he jokes, “They’re great and miss me when I’m gone, and then when I get back they spend two hours with me and then they’re back into their own world; they don’t even know I’m back half the time.” The upsides of working locum tenens The positives Stacy has experienced working locum tenens have been numerous — and far outweigh the downsides.\n“Obviously the pay is one thing.\nThe biggest benefit is you get to practice and see more people and get out there a little bit.\nI think it helps broaden your expertise in different areas.\nI’m able to take what I know from working at a Level I trauma hospital where I work full time, and I can take that expertise to a Level II hospital where I can now excel with that knowledge.” Another benefit Stacy’s found is the hours working locum tenens are less stressful as well.\nWorking locum tenens is kind of a “break” from his full-time job.\nHe’s found he makes the same amount of money, but since the usual deductions for insurance and taxes don’t come out of his check as an independent contractor, it leaves him with a “nice income.” With the ups come the downsides For Stacy, traveling and its inevitable consequences are two of the only downsides he’s found.\n“Traveling typically comes with the territory, but I don’t mind it.\nI was in the Air Force and I flew a lot, so it doesn’t bother me,” he says.\n“You’re away from your family, but it’s miniscule compared to the other stuff.” Another difficulty with locum tenens is the “not knowing,” or the initial trepidation that comes with being in a new place, learning new things.\nBut he says he’s become more acclimated to change.\nRegardless, Stacy insists he’ll continue working locum tenens, even if it’s on a part-time basis.\n“I’ve always had two jobs for some odd reason.\nI do a lot of trauma call, so I work 24-hour shifts and I don’t take a post-call day like residents do.\nThe hours I work locums are definitely less, and it’s less stressful as well.” Advice for other PAs His recommendation for those PAs who are on the fence? “They should at least try it.\nBecause you’ll never know what you’re going to get.\nOne of the best things about locums is it’s almost like test-driving a new car.\nIt could be an assignment that could lead you into a new job,” he says.\n“It will take you to areas that you probably would never go or even try.\nYou may say, ‘I’ll never work in that state,’ but working in the area may change your mind.” “By working locums, you can build friendships, try new locations, learn new techniques, and maybe even ‘test drive’ that new job that’s been waiting for you.” How locum tenens was the ideal path straight out of residency Jun 08, 2024 From locums right out of residency to teaching residents Jun 28, 2024 Freebies and discounts for physicians and advanced practice providers: Winter 2022-23 edition Nov 28, 2022 Categories Benefits of locum tenens Compensation & taxes Early career International locum tenens Late career Locums for NPs Locums for PAs Locums how-to Provider perspectives"

    "content": "Everything you need to know about your locum tenens agreement Jul 31, 2025 7 Min Read Erin Moore Being a locum tenens physician means working temporarily as an independent contractor for a hospital or medical facility.\nThis means you’ll be signing a locum tenens contract, an agreement between you and the facility directly or between you and the locums staffing agency that helped you find that assignment.\nThe latter details what you can expect from your relationship with the agency (like coverage of housing , travel , and other expenses) and what they expect from you.\nIs locums right for you? Understanding the basics of a locum tenens agreement A locum tenens agreement, simply put, is made up of your promise of service to a hospital or medical facility, alongside their promises to you about what your job will be, how much the assignment will pay, for how long, and under which circumstances you or the healthcare facility can terminate the agreement.\nOf course, there are many other nitty-gritty details, and it’s not a one-step process.\nSo let’s break it down.\nAssignment length and provisions for physicians The length of your agreement should align with the length of your potential assignment, and following that, the agreement spells out what it covers during that time.\nThese are the physician provisions, including what travel, transportation, and housing expenses are covered.\nMedical staffing agencies often also cover malpractice insurance , and the terms about this will be listed in your agreement, too.\nThis is also where the agency will spell out how payroll for your assignment will work.\nConditions for physicians Following this, physician conditions are pretty straightforward.\nThe main expectations are generally that you’ll provide accurate and up-to-date information to agencies to help them get your application through the credentialing process legally and as easily as possible.\nAfter that, agencies also expect you to agree to finish your assignment.\nKnow the legal lingo: What we’ve just covered may also be called your “ Rights and Responsibilities” in your agreement.\nContract limitations and terminations A non-compete agreement is a critical limitation in a deal with your medical staffing agency.\nThis is an agreement not to accept permanent or temporary positions directly with the hospital or facility you’re contracting for unless that entity pays a recruitment fee to the agency.\nWhen it comes to the possibility that you or your agency may need to end a contract early, your agreement should outline what this looks like for both parties.\nFor employers, contracts can be terminated if a physician has not met agreed-upon conditions, if their licensure is interrupted, or if they are disciplined while on assignment, among other causes.\nFor physicians, this means that if life happens, many agreements can be terminated with 30 days’ notice, and if it's for health reasons, no notice is required.\nKnow the legal lingo: An emergency that forces an early termination without notice may be referred to in your agreement as “ Force Majeure ,” or emergencies.\nNegotiate like a pro: Mastering contract negotiations (podcast) Accepting your agreement and reviewing your confirmation letter “The assignment confirmation, I would say, brings the contract to life,” says Natalie Ligett of Weatherby Healthcare .\nOnce you’ve accepted an assignment with an agency, they’ll let the hospital or facility you’re working with know you’re good to go.\nAt that point, you’ll receive your confirmation letter from the hospital or facility—the facility will also receive its own copy from the agency, which functions as a work order for them.\nThe letter outlines the specifics of the assignment, including pay rates, start and end dates, and worksite information.\nThe letter also outlines what protections are available to you as a physician.\nThese can include guaranteed payment for situations such as canceling a contract with less notice than your contract requires.\n“Physicians will want some assurance that if they go down this path, two weeks before their assignment is going to begin, they’re not going to have their assignment cancelled,” says Tim Smart, senior director of Global Medical Staffing .\nIdentifying red flags in a locums agreement Reviewing your first locum agreement may be intimidating, but it’s important to ensure you’re getting a deal that works for you.\nA quick scan for a few red flag items can make a huge difference in your experience.\nMake sure your malpractice insurance has a “tail” While it’s great that most locum tenens agreements from agencies automatically offer malpractice insurance coverage, you may want to look out for whether it’s coverage that has some extra security.\nThe best kind of malpractice insurance for your type of work comes with a “tail,” where, in the case of your ending your relationship with the agency, or their going out of business, you’re still covered long after care was dispensed.\nStandard malpractice insurance is claims-based, meaning you’re covered only if the incident and the claim happen while your policy is active.\nIt’s also handy to look for specific offerings like “$1M/$3,” which implies that you’ll get $1,000,000 per incident, and up to $3,000,000 of coverage total—for some locum tenens agencies, these also happen to be standard coverage offerings.\nKnow the legal lingo: If you see the word “ Indemnification ,” don’t panic.\nIndemnification is a legal term that shows up in all sorts of contracts.\nIn this context, it lays out what compensation for harm or loss there is or isn’t for the parties signing the agreement.\nIt functions as security against any legal liability for actions or events that may happen during your contract.\nSince malpractice insurance is already there to protect you, you don’t have to worry about liability, and your agency also shouldn’t seek any from you, given that other clauses in the contract protect them.\nCancellations and out clauses should be flexible As mentioned above, agreements will typically lay out the terms of your ability to end your contract, which is the first thing you should look for.\nHow much notice do you need to give? Got it? Okay, now what if you need to miss just a shift or two? What if you get sick, but not emergency-level incapacitated, and need a few days to recover from a cold? What you need is flexibility.\nThe Locum Tenens Guy shares an example of what a typical cancellation clauses might look like: “Professional may cancel any scheduled placement less than 30 days in advance by giving written notice…if Professional becomes unable by reason of emergency or medical condition to fulfill an agreed placement.” Agencies may also require that any cancellation or pause in work with less than 30 days’ notice be submitted in writing—which is a reasonable request.\nKnow your non-compete clause in and out Non-compete agreements protect agencies from losing the medical professionals they work with to another locum tenens agency or a hospital that wants to offer a permanent position.\nBut since one of the best parts of working as a locum tenens physician is that you can use it to test out new places you might want to work permanently, you should steer clear of non-compete agreements that are too prohibitive on your time and flexibility.\nIt’s also important to remember this clause and the binding non-compete period tied to your agreement, so that when you’ve finished working at a hospital you’d like to do permanent work with, you can.\nThe Locum Tenens Guy explains, “A few years after my last shift at one local hospital, I decided to pick up some shifts there again.\nThis time, I wanted to connect with them directly to have a long-term locum tenens hospitalist gig close to home.” However, since he didn’t give a 30-day written notice canceling his agreement with the agency when he finished that job, he was still bound to his non-compete.\nHe had to terminate his agreement then and wait for two years to apply to work at that hospital.\nThe non-compete is a tricky beast, as are termination and cancellation clauses.\nReview them diligently so you don’t get stuck working somewhere you’d rather not be.\nGood questions to ask your locum tenens recruiter Once you have a locum tenens agreement and/or a confirmation letter, you may still have a few questions.\nGetting clarity is always a good idea if you’re not getting it from your initial read.\nDon’t be afraid to ask these simple questions, because it could be the difference between a flexible and beneficial contract and one that limits you too much.\nKeep more cash in your pocket : 7 tax deductions for locum tenens doctors Know before you sign: Key details to confirm in your contract Locums agreement and confirmation letter Confirmation letter: What details are included in the confirmation letter?

    "content": "Is locum tenens right for you? 10 types of locum doctors May 06, 2025 7 Min Read Megan Lee Locum tenens doesn’t fit just one kind of doctor.\nContrary to what you might think, locum tenens can suit a variety of life stages, lifestyles, and life goals.\nWhether you are seeking financial independence, adventure and travel, or a better work-life balance, there's a locum tenens lifestyle waiting for you.\nHere are ten common types of locum physicians.\nFind out which one you might be.\nHow does locums work? 1.\nThe Finance Physician The Finance Physician is money-minded and strategically uses locum tenens to achieve specific financial goals.\nIf you're saving for a major purchase, paying down debt, or building a savings portfolio, locums can provide the supplemental income needed to execute a financial plan.\nLocums psychiatrist Dr.\nChinenye Onyemaechi Okolo-Taku used locums tenens to get herself out of student debt.\n“A lot of people focus only on saving or cutting back, but I took the approach of making more money.\nIf you want to make more money or pay off debt, take up an extra locums job.\nIt is one of the fastest ways to hit financial milestones,” says Dr.\nOkolo-Taku.\nHer newfound financial freedom has unlocked an incredible lifestyle for Dr.\nOnyemaechi Okolo-Taku.\n“Now that I am debt-free, I take more time off.\nI travel, I spend time with family, I get a nice massage — just do things that are completely unrelated to medicine.” Financial security allows for better work-life balance, and locum tenens gigs can get you there.\n2.\nThe Fresh Fellow What better way to get a taste of it all than to do just that by pursuing a variety of work placements? Fresh Fellows — recent graduates and new doctors — are providers who leverage locums tenens work to explore different practice settings, locations, schedule flexibility, and skill building.\n“I wasn’t ready to commit to an academic job or private practice, and I was unsure about what I wanted.\nLocums gave me the flexibility to figure it out,” says locums pediatrician, Dr.\nTrevor Cabrera .\n“In two years, I have worked in five or six states, held five DEA licenses, and worked in about a dozen facilities.\nI’d never get that kind of exposure in a traditional job.” These physicians are making new professional connections and gaining clarity about their ideal work environment.\n“Most doctors I know have only seen one hospital system in their career.\nThe exposure I’ve gained has expanded my professional network exponentially.\nI have worked in so many different hospitals and realized there’s not always just one right way to do things.\nEach place has its own approach, and I take those lessons with me,” says Dr.\nCabrera.\n3.\nThe Pioneer Practitioner Perhaps one of the better-known locums doctors — the one who is always planning their next trip.\nPioneer Practitioners are the travelers among us: those who use locums to explore new places, visit friends and family across the country, experience different cultures, and collect travel perks like airline and hotel points.\nTake Dr.\nGenevieve Jacobs , also known as The Locums Lady , whose thirst for adventure has been quenched by locums work.\n“What better way to be adventurous than getting paid to do the traveling? Sometimes I feel like I work a lot, then I check and realize I worked 180 days last year.\nThat’s still fewer than a full-time permanent job — and with way more adventure.” For Dr.\nJacobs, locums did far more for her both personally and professionally than she initially expected.\n“It’s very seamless the integration of locums into my life because a lot of what I wanted to do was to have the freedom to go on vacation.\nThe unexpected part for me was the professional growth,” says Dr.\nJacobs.\n“I’m learning so much about the business of medicine, of how different people do different things, approach different problems.” 4.\nThe Family Physician For the family-focused physician, locum tenens offers an ideal blend of professional fulfillment and personal flexibility.\nThese doctors prioritize work-life balance and leverage locum opportunities to create schedules that accommodate family commitments.\nPhysician assistant Cara Bosco succeeds at straddling the lines of being an “engaged parent” and a physician.\n“When I am not working, I am a stay-at-home mom.\nI get the kids ready for school, do all the typical things, and then I pack up my suitcase and I leave.\nI am gone for five days at a time, and then I come back and pick up where I left off,” she says.\n“Locums has given me the chance to create a work schedule that works for my family and doesn’t burn me out.\nI leave my work at work.\nI finish what I am doing while I am there, and then I make time for myself and my family.” With no mandatory overtime and the option to work locally or travel, the Family Physicians maintain control over their time to ensure they're present for the moments that matter most.\nFor more inspiration: A better way for a two-physician family to manage work, kids, and life (podcast) 5.\nThe Leisurely Locum Leisurely Locums are late-career physicians who use locums to slow down without stopping, enjoy a flexible schedule, have more time for hobbies, travel, and family, and still earn great compensation to build retirement savings and fund fun activities.\nDr.\nRonald Stiller , for example, is finding joy in being the resident “old timer.” “Even though I am ‘semi-retired,’ I still get to teach.\nYounger colleagues come to me as the ‘old man with gray hair’ and ask, ‘Can we go over a CT scan?’ That’s very gratifying.\nAt my current hospital, I even work with medical students.\nIt is rewarding to pass on knowledge while still practicing medicine.” Giving back to the medical community is just one of the many upsides of staying involved in medical work after a fulfilling career.\nThe scheduling flexibility provides a satisfying way to transition into retirement.\n“On average, I work one or two weeks per month, which gives me ample time to rest and play.\nIt is just fun to do, even as you are winding down your career,” Dr.\nStiller says.\n6.\nThe Local Locum The ideal Local Locum physician thrives on both flexibility and control.\nThese doctors enjoy the advantages of locum work — competitive pay, diverse clinical experiences, and adaptable schedules — all while staying close to home.\nThe local locum likes to have the best of both worlds.\nWhether supplementing a full-time position or building a dedicated local locum practice, they prioritize a work-life balance that traditional roles often lack.\nDr.\nBonnie Davis highlights how she strategically uses local locum placements for career flexibility between jobs.\n“I am at another transition point in my career, and I’ve always been able to work locums during transitions to help my family stay on our financial feet.” She advises: “It's affected us very positively, but you have to be aware of your money and you have to buy your own health insurance.\nIt’s not that it’s a downside, you just have to think a different way.” “I put the same into a locums job I would put into a permanent job.” Beyond leaning on nearby locums assignments during career transitions, local locums doctors may find local assignments on top of their full-time traditional work when they have extra time in their schedules or need extra money.\nOthers have created a roughly full-time local locums schedule that allows them more freedom than a permanent full-time position.\n7.\nThe Savvy Specialist Savvy Specialists are physicians who thrive on learning new skills, adapting to new environments, and growing their expertise through locum tenens work.\n“I worked at the same hospital for ten years, so I literally could do the job in my sleep.\nIt was just doing the same repeat every single day.\nComing to locums, learning how to use new equipment, different surgical kits, and different ways people practice medicine — it has completely changed my perspective,” says Dr.\nHolly Llobet.\n“Every time you go to a new hospital, it’s a different ultrasound, a different piece of medical equipment, and different procedures.\nYou are constantly adapting, which breaks up the monotony of doing things the same way every day for ten years.” Her husband, Dr.\nPaul Llobet — who also works as a locums tenens physician — concurs.\n“The ability to adjust in stride is something I have come to appreciate more than ever.” The arrangement excites the couple both professionally and personally.\n“I like to travel.\nI like being in a new culture, a new city, a new island, a new corner of the earth.\nI like working with my husband.\nWe are on the same schedule, so we work for a week and then travel together for a week.\nIt has been really good for us.” Savvy Specialists appreciate and embrace change because it keeps their minds and skills sharp.\n8.\nThe Helpful Humanitarian Helpful Humanitarians are doctors who find deep meaning in working with underserved populations, making a difference in communities in need, and using their physician skill set to give back.\nDr.\nAllison Liewen ’s passion for humanitarian work, medical work, and locum tenens assignments took her to a remote area of Alaska.\n\"I was flown in on a bush plane, dropped off on a gravel runway with my medical supplies, and no one was there.\nI just stood there as the plane flew away thinking, ‘Well, this is interesting.’\" That's the reality of providing care in remote, underserved areas — a challenge she embraced with open arms.\n\"Locums has made me a much stronger physician — I have had to learn to be adaptable, problem-solve on the fly, and work with limited resources.\nIf you are someone who thrives on variety, challenge, and making an impact in underserved communities, locum tenens can be a great fit.\" 9.\nThe Techie Tele-Doc The Techie Tele-Doc practices medicine via telehealth locums assignments , which allows them to practice medicine virtually from anywhere.\nThese doctors, like psychiatrist Dr.\nMariam Aboukar, hold multiple state licenses and are tech-savvy .\n“Telemedicine lets me connect with patients daily, and the experience is just as powerful as in-person care.\nI have cried with my patients on telehealth.\nI have laughed with them.\nThe connection is still very much there.” “You would be surprised how fulfilling virtual care can be.\nIt’s different, but it’s not less meaningful.” 10.\nThe Flexible Physician Flexible Physicians use their locums positions as bridges during a transition in life, whether due to a job change, family circumstances, travel abroad, fellowships, or other commitments that require flexibility.\nDr.\nGregory Kloehn found that locums can provide purpose and opportunity during uncertain times.\n“You’d be surprised how much things can change within a three- or six-month period.\nTo let the dust settle before making a big decision is really beneficial.\nLocums, to me, was a good intermediary.\nI could go and work in places, give good care to people, and be somewhere I was wanted and needed.” More on working locums during transitions: 3 ways physicians use locum tenens for career transitions Find out how locum tenens can fit into your lifestyle.\nLocums work is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it's a flexible career path that can accommodate a variety of physician

Download How to make the locum tenens physician credentialing process better While responsiveness and organization from the physician side are crucial, the credentialing system could still benefit from improvement, especially in today’s healthcare landscape, when it is more complex and faster paced than ever.\nInefficient credentialing processes waste valuable time and directly impact patient care.\nThis means increased administrative burdens and a lack of support, contributing to the growing issue of physician burnout.\nGood credentialing technology can help Technology can transform credentialing when designed with real-world workflows in mind and implemented effectively.\nGood technology can automate repetitive tasks, centralize provider data, and eliminate unnecessary steps.\nFor example, credentialing platforms like Modio OneView have tools that eliminate repetitive tasks and capabilities like auto-populating forms.\nThese features can turn a once 90-minute chore into a five-minute task.\nBe an advocate to transform locum tenens credentialing But technology alone isn’t enough.\nWe all need to advocate for smarter systems; physicians should be willing to speak up and challenge outdated practices, both at the facilities where we work and at a national level.\nFor example, why do medical school credentials need to be re-verified every two years? Why are we still using fax machines? Why does credentialing vary so much from one system to the next? Smarter, continuous credentialing models are possible, but only if the industry at large is willing to let go of what's no longer necessary and instead embrace progress.\nLooking ahead: The future of physician credentialing With artificial intelligence and automation already getting incorporated into the credentialing process (identifying red flags, validating credentials, and improving communication between credentialing teams), the future of credentialing looks promising.\nCurrently, credentialing files are often built from scratch with each new assignment.\nWhile the credentialing sphere is still developing, I’m hopeful that the healthcare industry will build towards one, single, unified provider record that follows a physician throughout their career, updates in real time, and is accessible across all healthcare organizations.\nFinal note on locum tenens credentialing For physicians entering the locum tenens space, the credentialing process is more than a formality — it’s a professional advantage.\nThe better you understand it, the smoother your professional experiences will be.\nCredentialing isn’t just paperwork.\nIt is the front door to the work you care about most: caring for patients.\nInterested in starting a career in locums?

    "content": "A physician’s guide to telehealth locum tenens Mar 12, 2025 7 Min Read Megan Lee If you’ve ever wondered what telehealth locum tenens is like, it can be a huge time-saver, help prevent burnout, and provide an additional revenue stream for physicians in a variety of life stages or circumstances.\nTelehealth locum tenens can be a lucrative alternative career or complement your traditional employment.\nLet’s take a closer look at how to do telehealth locums.\nWhat is locum tenens? What to expect when starting a telehealth locums assignment Timeline and onboarding Telehealth assignments can start very quickly, often within a few weeks.\nThe hours can also vary, as telehealth physicians can work in different time zones, nights, and/or weekends.\nLuckily, telehealth locums also allows you to set a schedule that works for you and the telehealth company — whether it’s a few hours per week or a full-time gig.\nOnboarding usually focuses on two parts: clinical operations and technology operations.\nThe most successful physicians working in telehealth locum tenens are savvy and familiar with using many different telehealth platforms.\nLicensing for telehealth locums Telehealth companies prefer doctors with specific state licenses already in hand.\nThe more licenses you have, the more pay you’re likely to be able to negotiate since you will be eligible to treat more patients.\nPro tip: If you want to obtain more licenses, wait until you’re already working in locums telehealth and find out what states the company wants licenses for before going ahead and getting them proactively.\nWhat to look for in an agency The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) is an agreement among participating states to streamline the licensing process for traveling physicians.\nJoining this can make you more attractive to telehealth companies.\n“I live in Florida, so I use the analogy that the IMLC is like a Disney FastPass.\nIt allows you to move quickly through a process and get licensed in more than 30 states.\nIt is a great avenue for physicians who are open to a lot of different places and allows physicians to be viable candidates for a slew of jobs they might not otherwise be qualified for,” says Greg Crowe, a locum tenens consultant from Weatherby Healthcare .\nMany locum tenens physicians working in telehealth find the licensure logistics particularly difficult to navigate.\nThis is where a locum tenens staffing agency may be helpful.\n“When I was doing locum tenens in South Dakota, I had patients in North Dakota.\nSo, I had to have a North Dakota license and then a DEA number since I was a prescriber.\nThere was also a state-controlled substance license I had to get.” Dr.\nKellie Sweet, pediatric neurologist says.\n“Managing the licensing logistics can be quite onerous, so that's another benefit of working with a locums company such as CompHealth.\nThey can help you keep your licensing up to date for where you are practicing telemedicine” Dr.\nSweet says.\nThe inside scoop on licensing: Everything you need to know about locum tenens licensing How compensation works for telehealth Patient volume determines your pay in telehealth rather than hourly wages.\nMany telehealth providers are paid based on the number of patients seen, regardless of the time spent on each interaction.\nOther factors affecting locum tenens telehealth pay include how and when you take your appointments.\nFor instance, video, phone, and text messaging communications offer different pay rates.\nSimilarly, working off-peak hours may have lower pay rates due to lower patient volume.\nPeak times are often nights and weekends.\nSince most telehealth appointments are for urgent care, the volume of patients can fluctuate significantly and unpredictably.\nThis can lead to variations in income from week to week.\nThe benefits of telehealth locums Eliminate your commute time If you feel limited in travel or don’t want to spend time traveling to a brick-and-mortar clinic or facility, working telehealth medicine as a locum may be a good alternative.\n“As somebody constantly on the go, I feel I can always better manage my time.\nThat is the thing that money can't buy: time.\nSo, I find the lack of commute to be exceptionally valuable — I get to spend more time in my community,” says psychiatrist Dr.\nMariam Aboukar.\nEarn extra income Many physicians want to earn additional income while looking for a new in-person opportunity .\nSince telehealth appointments are in the highest demand on nights and weekends, physicians with more traditional day jobs can supplement their income with these flexible placements.\nUse telehealth to ease back into work Some physicians want to ease back into their medical practices after taking time off for other pursuits and need a transitional role or a flexible position that allows a smooth re-entry into the workforce.\n“I realized that I needed some time off because I was too ill; I needed time to reboot.\nWhat use am I to my patients if I am not healthy?” Dr.\nAboukar says.\nOther physicians may seek a gradual reintegration after a period away from their medical practice.\nOr perhaps they are in between commitments but would like something to fill their time in the interim.\nMake outpatient follow-up visits easier Neurology and psychiatry are just two specialties where telehealth can be more suitable for ongoing outpatient care.\n“Teleneurology would be wonderful in pediatrics for follow-up appointments for say, epilepsy.\nIf someone's stable or having seizures, we need to talk to discuss medication changes.\nIf they have already been established and had a neurological exam, their exam is unlikely to change over time.\nThis could be a great way to give them the care that they need via teleneurology,” neurologist Dr.\nSweet says.\nFill the gaps in rural or health shortage areas Telehealth can significantly improve healthcare access in underserved communities .\nMany specialties have a shortage of providers, so finding locum tenens placements in telehealth medicine can expand meaningful access.\nBecause telehealth eliminates the travel component of healthcare, it can improve access for patients with limited mobility or transportation options.\n“Telehealth also solves some of the considerations related to the socioeconomic status of some of the patients.\nIt takes out struggles like being unable to afford gas or getting to an appointment if a patient’s car is broken, for instance,” says Dr.\nSweet.\nLocum tenens placements in telehealth medicine can also effectively address provider gaps by remotely connecting patients with qualified specialists.\nAvoid burnout If you are feeling burnt out or want to quit medicine, working telehealth locum tenens placements can be a good way to continue building your career while having flexibility and work/life balance.\n“I found myself really liking locums because it was flexible.\nYou get to try different areas around the United States but aren’t necessarily married to it.\nYou can figure out if it is a fit — see if you like the people and the environment.\nAnd telemedicine gigs go a step further: they are extremely flexible,” shares Dr.\nAboukar.\nDo you have a question about telehealth locum tenens that wasn't addressed by this article?

    "content": "7 reasons you should work locum tenens with an agency (and not on your own) Jan 07, 2025 7 Min Read Megan Lee Navigating the complexities of a locum tenens assignment on your own can be daunting.\nBy letting an agency handle the paperwork, negotiations, and logistics, you can spend time focusing on more important things — like caring for patients and being with your family and friends.\nHere are 7 benefits you'll get when you partner with a locum tenens agency instead of doing it alone when working locum tenens.\nCompare locums agencies 1.\nInside scoop on jobs “If you're a resident or doctor interested in locum tenens positions but aren't aware of open opportunities, it's essential to connect with a locum tenens company or someone who can help you navigate the job market,” says Dr.\nHania Kahlon, a family medicine physician.\nLarge agencies tend to have established relationships with healthcare facilities nationwide (and sometimes internationally).\nThey often know about jobs that may not be posted anywhere — which means they have access to a wider range of locum tenens opportunities than you could find on your own.\nThis means instead of calling around to different facilities, the agency will do the searching for you.\nRecruiters can match you with assignments that align with your specialization, location preferences, and desired schedule, giving you more control over your career and better work/life balance.\nGet expert advice: How to find the right locums recruiter 2.\nLess admin, paperwork, and overhead Dr.\nAndrew Wilner, a neurologist who has frequently worked locums, believes that “administrative hurdles constitute one of the most frustrating obstacles for locum tenens work” — but an agency can make it easier.\nThis is yet another perk of securing locum tenens positions through an agency, as they take care of all the details — like credentialing, licensing, and other approvals — on your behalf.\nNurse practitioner Sophia Khawly says, “I love when agencies offer proactive licensing .\nThis means they assist and pay for state licenses before I even accept a job with them in that state.\nThis will increase the possibilities of finding my next assignment because most sites want you to already be licensed there before they sign you on.” This approach saves you valuable time and energy, allowing you to focus your efforts on patient care instead of paperwork.\n3.\nTravel booked and paid for by the agency Another benefit of working with an agency is that they handle all travel reservations, including flights, rental cars, and lodging.\n“They find flights, pay for hotels , and ultimately take care of you,” says orthopedic surgeon Dr.\nNicholas Kusnezov of his locum tenens support team.\n“They’re very attentive to my travel needs.” With an agency, you won’t have to deal with (or pay for) travel logistics on your own.\nThe company’s travel department will book these logistics, leaving you one less thing to think about — not to mention fewer expenses.\nHit the road: The ultimate guide to locum tenens travel 4.\nFair and reliable compensation While bigger agencies may not always have the highest rates, they do often have better support and pay quickly and on time.\nLocum tenens physician Dr.\nMarye McCroskey says, “Usually, a larger agency is a well-oiled machine.\nYou are paid promptly, sometimes weekly.” Agencies also have experience negotiating contracts and can advocate on your behalf to secure competitive pay, whereas finding locum tenens jobs independently requires negotiating terms and rates directly with healthcare facilities.\nWhat’s more, agencies’ deep understanding of market rates can ensure you're compensated fairly for your skills and experience.\nAnd if you’re an NP or PA, you can take advantage of other benefits, too.\nKhawly says that some agencies offer advanced practice providers the option of becoming a W-2 employee .\nThat means that benefits like health insurance, 401(k) contributions, and Continuing Education Unit (CEU) reimbursements are included in the overall compensation package.\n5.\nIncluded malpractice coverage Without an agency, you’ll have to provide your own malpractice insurance, which can be quite expensive.\nLocums agencies tend to provide malpractice coverage to its providers as part of the locums agreement.\nFor instance, agencies Weatherby Healthcare and CompHealth both provide malpractice coverage for locum tenens workers, including claims-made and tail coverage with $1M/$3M limits.\nThese insurance policies cover legal fees and potential settlements or judgments and protect your personal assets.\n6.\nOngoing support during and after assignments Agencies provide a range of support services to make your locum tenens experience smooth and hassle-free.\nThese services may include 24/7 support from experienced account managers, housing assistance, and guidance on tax implications and other financial matters.\n“When you work with a big company like Weatherby, there are a lot of personal benefits,” says Dr.\nJim Mock, an emergency medicine physician.\n“At the end of the year, when it becomes tax time, I only have one source of revenue, so all of my tax reporting is very streamlined.” Khawly further recommends finding an agency that has your back.\n“My favorite agencies are the ones that prioritize the locum tenens provider.\nFor instance, if there is a conflict between the site and the clinician, the winning agency is the one that sticks up for the clinician.” 7.\nMore peace of mind By handling all of the details, agencies allow you to prioritize what you do best: practicing medicine.\nYou'll have a dedicated point of contact to answer questions, address concerns, and provide support throughout your assignment.\nWhen reflecting on his locum tenens assignment through Weatherby Healthcare, Chicago-based physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist Dr.\nEdward Babigumira shares, “Weatherby has a really good team.\nEverything works so smoothly.\nI’ve never had an issue.\nThe preparation is always good — no surprises.\nIt is a really strong team.” In short: Working with a locum tenens agency can make your experience working locums better than if you were to do it on your own, especially when you are just starting out.\nPro tip: If you already know someone working locums, have them refer you to an agency so that you can both get a bonus.\nFor example, check out CompHealth's and Weatherby's referral programs.\nGet started with locum tenens How does malpractice insurance work for locum

    "content": "What to look for in a locum tenens agency: 7 factors to consider Dec 23, 2024 7 Min Read Lindsay Wilcox If you’re new to temporary work as a healthcare provider, it can be challenging to identify the factors that make for a good locum tenens agency.\nFortunately, it doesn’t have to be hard to make an informed decision.\nA recent survey conducted by CHG Healthcare and Hanover Research asked physicians which attributes are most important to them when working with a locum tenens agency.\nHere are the seven criteria physicians identified as the most important when choosing a locum tenens company along with tips from experts on how to evaluate them.\nLocum tenens 101 1.\nProfessionalism and ethics More than 85% of physicians surveyed said professionalism and ethics was very important in a locum tenens agency.\nHowever, you may not be able to gauge a company’s ethics from one phone call with a recruiter or by looking at their website.\nStart with the National Association of Locum Tenens Organizations (NALTO) , which requires all members to follow a code of ethics and maintain high industry standards.\nNALTO ensures that both physicians and healthcare facilities are treated fairly.\nCheck out the list of agency members to see whether the company you’re considering is there (not all agencies are part of NALTO).\n“If the agency is not part of NALTO, I suggest you request three references from physicians that they’ve previously placed and contact them directly,” says Dr.\nVlad Dzhashi, who manages the hospitalist blog The Locum Tenens Guy .\nDr.\nAndrew Wilner, a neurologist who has spent time working locums with CompHealth , offers this advice: “I would choose a recruiter (or two).\nTalk to multiple people, but you don't have to send your CV to everyone.\nIn 5 to 10 minutes, you should have a good idea of whether or not you can trust this person.\nThis business has a high turnover, and knowing how long someone's been in the industry can also be very telling.” Get the details right: 5 tips for looking for your first locum tenens assignment 2.\nDepth of support services Finding a job within your specialty and at your desired salary is only part of the locum tenens puzzle.\nFor example: Does your agency help book your travel, housing, and transportation? Is a representative available 24/7 in case you have issues with your assignment? It’s important to evaluate the agency’s support services, which may be why 83% of physicians surveyed ranked this attribute so highly when choosing which agency to work with.\nOne of the biggest benefits of working with an agency is help with credentialing and licensing , says nurse practitioner Sophia Khawly.\n“I love when agencies offer proactive licensing .\nThis means they assist and pay for state licenses before I even accept a job with them in that state.\nThis can increase the possibility of finding my next assignment because most sites want you to already be licensed there before they sign you on,” Khawly explains.\n“It's also a plus that if I've applied for a state license on my own, the agency reimburses me for my license costs once I start working in that state.” 3.\nFair compensation A big draw to locum tenens assignments is the ability to earn a large paycheck, so it’s no surprise that 80% of surveyed physicians also ranked compensation as “very important” or “extremely important.” However, it’s worth thinking about earnings more broadly instead of only looking at the daily rate.\nWhile bigger locum tenens agencies may not always have the highest rates, they often offer better support and pay you quickly and on time.\nIf you go with an agency that also covers your housing, travel, and transportation costs, these benefits are part of your compensation as well.\n“Smaller locum agencies usually have just a few employers to which they are dedicated.\nYou may have to make your own travel arrangements and be reimbursed.\nBecause they are smaller, the pay rate is frequently higher, but they typically pay more slowly.\nWith one company, it was up to six weeks,” explains Dr.\nMarye McCroskey.\n“Ultimately, the choice of agency size will depend upon your personal preferences.” A physician answers your questions: How do I choose a locum tenens agency? 4.\nResponsiveness Whether you’re contacting a recruiter for the first time or trying to get in touch with someone at midnight when an issue arises on assignment, the best locum tenens agency is responsive — and 77% of surveyed physicians ranked this agency quality as “very important.” “My recruiter isn’t just my recruiter; he’s my overall representative.\nI feel like any question I have I can go through him.\nI can shoot him a text or email pretty much whenever, and he usually responds pretty quickly or lets me know who exactly I need to talk to,” says Dr.\nMcKayla Sakimura, who works locum tenens with CompHealth.\n“He just understands me.” 5.\nSpecialty-specific expertise Another top trait to look for in a locum tenens agency is specialty-specific expertise.\nWhile smaller agencies offer certain benefits (which may include higher take-home pay), larger agencies generally have more specialty-specific recruiters who focus on just one or two specialties.\nAt a smaller firm, one recruiter may cover all specialties.\nWeatherby Healthcare ensures that its consultants focus on a single specialty and offers training when they join the company.\n“Our consultants know how doctors in that specialty are scheduled, what they’re required to do, and who they work with.\nThere’s too much risk involved to not be a specialist,” explains senior learning and development specialist Matthew Gillis.\n“For the sake of the patient, for the provider, for the hospital, for our company, everything has to be right, and that’s what being specialty-specific does.\nIt allows our consultants to be experts .” 6.\nPositive reputation among peers Physicians who participated in the survey also said that a positive reputation was important when choosing a company.\nDo your own research to determine if the agency is reputable and easy to work with.\nFind out how long they’ve been in business, ask colleagues whether they’ve heard anything about certain companies, and do a quick online search to get a feel for what others say about working with the agency.\nIf a locum tenens company is ranked highly by peers, chances are good that the recruiters and staff working there are also satisfied with their jobs, offering a positive experience for everyone.\nDr.\nJulie Long was initially drawn to Weatherby Healthcare because she’d heard good things about the agency.\n“The organization has a great reputation.\nAnd once I met my recruiter, I thought, ‘I don’t need to look any further.’ I don’t think it was Carla that convinced me to do locums, but it was Carla that convinced me I wanted to do locums with Weatherby,” Dr.\nLong says.\nInsider tip: Know someone already doing locums? Ask them to connect you with their agency — you could both cash in.\nAgencies like CompHealth and Weatherby Healthcare have two-sided referral reward programs worth checking out.\nGet the facts: Debunking 5 myths about working locum tenens with an agency 7.\nEase of initial application Finally, surveyed physicians noted that ease of initial application was a top factor when choosing a locum tenens agency.\nNo one wants to fill out a mountain of paperwork just to talk to a recruiter or start browsing open jobs.\nCheck out the agency’s website to get a feel for their process.\nDo they have a simple web form that allows you to contact a representative or an easy-to-find phone number? Does the agency give you the option to choose how they respond (text, phone, or email)? Talking directly to a recruiter about a certain job you’re interested in can also help you evaluate how the agency is structured.\nKnowing the top factors other physicians look for when taking temporary jobs can help you identify the best locum tenens agency for your needs.\nClick the button below to get started.\nCompare locums agencies How does malpractice insurance work for locum tenens physicians?

Those who take a genuine interest in advocating for the well-being of others establish the most worthwhile relationships.\nMy preferred recruiters have taken caution to avoid presenting me to facilities with unsafe work environments due to hospital politics or poor administration.\nThey’ve also recommended I take days off when I appear to be burnt out or overworked.\nWhile it is true that words can just be words, taking a sincere interest in my well-being has been a consistent factor in determining my return business, even if only to refer colleagues.\n2.\nAre they offering me the assignments I want? A good salesperson must know what they’re selling and to whom they’re selling it.\nIt makes no sense to sell a bike to a mermaid, just like it makes no sense to offer me a clinic job when I request something inpatient.\nAs a full-time locum tenens physician, I am constantly approached about jobs — and duties — I have no interest in, in places I would never want to be.\nWhen I am incessantly solicited for a position that is clearly not the right fit for me, I no longer take the recruiter’s calls.\nHaving a recruiter listen to what I want makes me want to hear them out .\nIt’s exhausting to repeat myself to new people every day.\nNew to locums? Here’s some advice from a locums pro 3.\nDoes the recruiter know who I am and what I do? I’m always frustrated when I speak to a recruiter who hasn’t taken the time to understand what kind of doctor I am, what it took to get where I am today, and the clinical duties befitting of me.\nAfter a decade of training, including three years of focus and board certification in pediatrics, I am always disheartened by some recruiters' lack of specialty knowledge.\nFor example, I don’t care for adult patients, but I am routinely solicited for their care.\nIt’s clearly poor form and shows a lack of interest and time investment in me as a provider.\n4.\nIs the recruiter persistent or verging on harassment? Notably, one of my biggest pet peeves is a lack of respect for the word “no.” I have always appreciated persistence and tenacity, but it’s easy to cross the line into harassment.\nRecurrent pestering from one agent not only turned me off from ever working with him in the future, but it also cast a bad light on his company and associates.\nSometimes, a little space is all that’s needed — recruitment goes both ways, and I will seek out opportunities when I’m ready.\nLocum tenens 101: The newcomer’s guide for physicians 5.\nHow well does the recruiter communicate? Communication can make a monumental difference in the strength and longevity of partnerships.\nOne recruiter’s poorly worded, delayed responses regarding travel and payroll made me reconsider taking the assignment — despite the above-market compensation and a group of people I clicked with in a place I loved.\nMany characteristics make a great recruiter, and each fit is individual.\nAt the end of the day, transparency, trust, consistency, and communication form the foundation of a strong working relationship.\nFocusing on providing great service while respecting healthy boundaries might take a little more effort on the recruiter's part, but it builds the strongest bridges in the long term.\nQuiz: Are you ready for locums?

Nov 18, 2024 7 Min Read Dr.\nMarye McCroskey Experienced locum tenens physician Dr.\nMarye McCroskey answers some commonly asked questions about choosing a locum tenens agency.\nWhen physicians first start exploring locums work, it can be overwhelming.\nConnecting with work opportunities and locum tenens recruiters is not always intuitive.\nYears ago, when I started on this journey, I went online and signed up for information from all the locum tenens agencies I could find — bad idea.\nYou can imagine my subsequent email inbox and the phone calls.\nSo many phone calls.\nMy advice? Don’t do what I did.\nAnd to help you do it the right way, here are some questions you need to ask yourself before you start.\nLocum pro tips Do I want to work with a large or small locums company? Larger locum tenens agencies have recruiters who work with physicians and recruiters who work with healthcare facilities.\nWhile this may feel like an extra layer, it functions quite smoothly.\nPhysician recruiters are often specialty-specific and have access to a more extensive variety of job opportunities and locations to work.\nLarger agencies have departments that coordinate locum tenens details like licensing and credentialing.\nThe larger locums agencies also have separate departments that arrange — with your input — travel and housing.\nUsually, a larger agency is a well-oiled machine.\nYou are paid promptly, sometimes weekly.\nSmaller locum agencies usually have just a few employers to which they are dedicated.\nThe physician recruiter is often the company contact and is primarily responsible for filling those positions.\nThat means fewer layers.\nYou may have to make your own travel arrangements and be reimbursed.\nBecause they are smaller, the pay rate is frequently higher, but they typically pay more slowly.\nWith one company, it was up to six weeks.\nMost locum tenens agencies are reputable , and you can research them online.\nUltimately, the choice of agency size will depend upon your personal preferences.\nI have worked with both large and small companies, and particularly if I am far away from home, it is reassuring to have that big company backing me up.\nHow do I find a recruiter? Speak to several recruiters and see who you fit well with.\nDo they respond promptly with answers to your questions? Do they seem to understand your specialty? Do they bring opportunities to you that fit the criteria you requested? Then, pick one recruiter at each company to be your point person.\nTypically, recruiters are very respectful of physicians’ time.\nFind the best recruiter: What one physician looks for What about online job listing boards? Locum tenens agencies will give you examples of jobs that may be available in your area.\nOften, they are outdated, the listings are no longer available, or it is just a company ad.\nIn the recent past, even if I contact the job listing, they rarely respond.\nIn short, I wouldn’t waste my time.\nSo, how do I find a locum tenens assignment? Allow your recruiter to do their research and bring you opportunities.\nDiscuss what you like and don’t like about possible assignments and see if the employers are flexible.\nFor example, if the job is Monday through Friday, but you only want to work four days a week, is that an option? Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want, just be reasonable.\nGet the inside scoop: 5 tips for looking for your first locum tenens assignment The recruiter will then “present” you to the company.\nIt can take several weeks for a response, so be patient.\nThe position is not binding until you agree to the terms of the assignment.\nInterviews and paperwork will follow, but your recruiter will walk you through the process.\nThey will help you plan for your length of stay and stay in touch with you when you need to look for your next assignment.\nIf you decide to work with more than one agency, keep each of them apprised of your availability so that you can apply for positions in a timely fashion.\nWhen you first decide to try locums work, it may feel like the agencies are pouncing on you and all want a piece of you.\nIn reality, physician recruiters want to find you suitable work opportunities and, ultimately, are on your side.\nIs locums right for you?

Here are the top 10 highest-paying states for locum physicians Serving the local community Dr.\nMichael Cormican, a trauma surgeon and surgical critical care intensivist, began working locum tenens in his community in addition to his regular full-time employment.\n“The money is nice,” he said, but his real motivation was making an impact in his community.\n“It just seems like the right thing to do,” he said.\n“If I’m not doing anything to give back, it just seems sort of selfish.” Want to give back farther from home? Here are ways to take an international sabbatical (Global Medical Staffing) What staying local looks like Local locum tenens can take several forms, varying in travel distance and assignment length.\nGenerally, a travel distance of up to 200 miles is considered local.\nDr.\nJanakiraman said her longest driving distance from home has been 30 minutes, while Dr.\nCormican stays even closer to home — in some cases, just two miles.\n“Where I live is centrally located for two or three of the hospitals I go to,” he said.\nAssignments that are an easy commute from home don’t involve hotel stays.\nHowever, accommodations are available if your drive time is longer.\nDr.\nKim tries to take assignments that don’t keep him away from his family for too long.\n“Usually, the longest I’m away is about a week.\nOther times, I’ve found that there’s plenty of work locally and within short distances.” Similarly, assignment lengths can vary from a few shifts to a few months.\nDr.\nCormican fills in shifts here and there in local hospitals, while Dr.\nTrewick’s longest assignment has been six months.\nThe benefits of staying local The most obvious benefit of working as a local locum tenens is avoiding lengthy air travel.\nHowever, several other perks can also make it worthwhile.\nReduced licensing burden Providers who travel far and wide may need to obtain multiple state licenses.\nWorking local locums eliminates the need to apply for new licenses , making it easier and faster to get to work.\nCommunity involvement Staying local lets you get involved with your children’s schools or other community organizations.\nAlso, working in local facilities helps you build strong relationships within the local healthcare ecosystem.\nSpontaneity Full-time employees often need to schedule time off months in advance, making spontaneous plans impossible.\nLocal, short-term locums work enables spur-of-the-moment activities and vacations.\nDr.\nKim, for example, was able to take a trip to London with his son without “having to really plan things out six months in advance like I used to have to do.” How to find local locum tenens jobs The availability of local locums work depends entirely on your community.\nRecruiters say that large East and West Coast cities may have fewer local opportunities because these cities have a high density of providers.\nSmall towns may also offer fewer opportunities.\nMid-sized cities seem to be the sweet spot for local work.\nThat said, you can take steps to improve the likelihood of finding local assignments no matter where you live.\nWork with multiple agencies It’s all about supply and demand, said Dr.\nTrewick.\n“I made sure I had multiple recruiters working on my behalf at all times to maximize the number of days I could work in a month.” On the other hand, it pays to be selective about who you partner with.\nResearch locum tenens agencies and choose two or three to move forward with.\nThis will ensure you only receive assignments that match your requirements instead of a flood of so-so opportunities.\nExpand your distance requirements You may need to cast a wider net to find enough local work.\nIf you’re willing to drive up to five hours for an assignment, you’ll have more opportunities while avoiding air travel.\nPlus, you’ll still be close enough to travel home when you have a few days between shifts.\nBe flexible Being flexible about your availability, assignment preferences, and maximum driving distance will enable you to pick up more work.\nA little patience can help, too.\n“Things are so fluid,” said Dr.\nCormican.\n“There’s a lot of flexibility in it.\nIf there’s nothing open today, that doesn’t mean there’s not going to be anything open tomorrow.” Is locums a good fit?

    "content": "A comprehensive licensing guide for locum tenens physicians Sep 18, 2024 7 Min Read Allison Riley Embarking on a locum tenens career offers exciting opportunities for physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners to gain diverse experiences and flexibility in their work.\nHowever, one of the initial hurdles many face is navigating the complex process of obtaining licenses in multiple states.\nThis can feel overwhelming, especially for those just starting.\nIn this article, we’ll provide practical tips and strategies to streamline the licensing process for locum tenens, helping you focus on what truly matters — delivering quality care to patients nationwide.\nWhat documents do you need? The licensing process: An overview The medical licensing process begins with completing the state application and submitting any required documents, such as copies of your diploma, postgraduate training certificates, notarized forms, and background checks.\nThe application will outline precisely what is needed.\nBe sure to complete the application as thoroughly and accurately as possible to avoid delays.\nOnce the application is completed and submitted to the state medical board, the next step is to obtain all necessary direct source verifications.\nThese typically include exam scores, verification of all state licenses, medical school and postgraduate training verifications, and possibly employment verifications, references, or board certifications, depending on the state.\nThe applicant must contact these sources and ensure that the verifications are sent to the medical board.\nOnce the board has received the completed application and all verifications, it enters a review process, after which the license is issued.\nRead licensing tips from the pros? Tips from locum tenens doctors When should you start the licensing process? A general rule of thumb is to allow 90 days for licensing before starting an assignment.\nHowever, the time required to obtain a license can vary widely from state to state, depending on the speed of the licensing board and the complexity of the application — ranging anywhere from one week to six months.\nWhile most licensing boards provide estimated time frames on their websites, experienced locums recommend calling the board directly for a more accurate estimate.\nWhat costs are involved? The cost of obtaining and maintaining multiple state medical licenses can be significant, with fees varying widely by state.\nFor instance, while a license in Wisconsin may cost around $140, an initial license in California can be upwards of $1,300.\nAdditional expenses may include the Federation Credentials Verification Service (FCVS) application, DEA registration, and each state’s Controlled Substance Registration, which requires renewal fees every few years.\nLicensing verification services and miscellaneous costs, such as fingerprinting and postage, add to the expense.\nTypically, the provider is responsible for these costs, but locum tenens working with a reputable agency may have some of these expenses covered.\nAvoiding common licensing pitfalls Even small mistakes in the licensing process can significantly slow down the approval timeline.\nOne common error is incomplete or inaccurate information on the application, particularly with dates and time gaps in employment history.\nTo avoid this, it's crucial to understand the licensing board's specific requirements, ensure all forms are fully completed, and avoid guessing any details.\nAnother frequent issue is failing to disclose past disciplinary actions, which can cause complications if discovered later.\nFor physicians who have been in practice for many years — especially surgeons — frequent handwashing can sometimes lead to worn fingerprints and difficulty completing the fingerprinting requirement for background checks.\nPlan for repeat attempts, if necessary, to avoid delays.\nAbove all, being thorough and proactive in gathering necessary information beforehand can prevent these setbacks.\nFederation Credentials Verification Service The Federation Credentials Verification Service (FCVS), provided by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB), offers a fast and convenient solution for managing medical credentials.\nThe FCVS maintains a centralized repository of verified educational and training information, which can be efficiently shared with multiple state medical boards.\nThis service is particularly valuable for locum tenens providers, as it simplifies the credentialing process by avoiding the need to repeatedly submit verification documents to each state board individually.\nWhile 14 state licensing boards require FCVS, all medical boards recognize it for primary source verification.\nUtilizing FCVS can significantly expedite the licensing process and reduce administrative burdens for providers working across state lines.\nInterstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) Physicians must be licensed in each state where they plan to practice, and typically, there is no automatic reciprocity between states.\nAn exception to this is with states that participate in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact , or IMLC.\nThe IMLC is an agreement among participating U.S.\nstates and territories to streamline the licensing process for physicians who want to practice in multiple states.\nIt offers an expedited pathway to licensure for physicians who qualify.\nThe first requirement for physicians to participate in the IMLC is to hold a full, unrestricted medical license in an IMLC member state that can serve as a declared State of Principal License (SPL).\nAfter verifying a physician’s eligibility for the Compact, the SPL shares this information with additional states where the physician wants to practice medicine.\nBy expedited information-sharing, participating states can significantly speed up the licensure process.\nThe IMLC currently includes 40 states, the District of Columbia, and the Territory of Guam.\nOther states are also introducing legislation to adopt the Compact.\nLocum tenens vs.\npermanent licensing: What sets them apart? The licensing process for locum tenens positions is generally the same as for permanent positions, with states requiring the same application steps and verifications.\nHowever, one key difference is the level of support you may receive if you work with a reputable locum tenens agency.\nThese agencies often handle much of the licensing process for you, from managing paperwork to coordinating with licensing boards and primary sources for verifications.\nThis support can make the process smoother and less time-consuming, allowing you to focus more on preparing for your assignment rather than navigating the licensing complexities on your own.\nWant to learn more about telehealth ? Here are your telehealth licensing answers (CHG Healthcare) Telehealth licensing: What you need to know Telehealth has become a highly cost-effective and popular complement to in-person care, addressing a wide range of patient needs.\nA recent survey found that 90% of Americans had a positive telehealth experience and favored it over in-person visits because of its convenience.\nFederal and state laws generally require healthcare providers to be licensed in both the state where they are located and the state where the patient is during a telehealth visit.\nFor example, a provider in Washington treating a patient in Florida must be licensed in both states.\nHowever, many states offer cross-state licensing or telehealth-specific exceptions allowing out-of-state providers to deliver services if conditions are met.\nUnderstanding the telehealth licensing requirements for each state where you plan to practice is essential.\nAs with in-person locum tenens, the IMLC can streamline and simplify the licensing process for physicians providing telehealth services to hold licenses in multiple states.\nStrategic license management: How and when to keep licenses active Renewing medical licenses in multiple states offers a quicker and more streamlined process than reapplying after a lapse.\nWhile you still need to cover renewal fees, the application process is generally shorter and less complex.\nHowever, when managing multiple medical licenses, it’s essential to be strategic about which ones to keep active due to the renewal costs and continuing medical education (CME) requirements.\nIf you are sure you won’t be practicing in a particular state, it may be reasonable to let that license lapse.\nFor states where renewal fees are high but the license is easy to reacquire, consider allowing those licenses to expire only if you're unlikely to need them in the near future.\nSome states also offer the option to switch your license status from “active” to “inactive,” which exempts you from CME requirements, though you’ll still need to pay renewal fees.\nAdditionally, state-controlled substance registrations can be allowed to lapse without affecting your medical license and can typically be renewed quickly if needed.\nLocum tenens licensing: Key tips and takeaways Get organized Keep electronic copies of all transcripts, certificates, and records and store them in one easy-to-access place.\nConfirm the chronology Ensure accurate dates for employment, graduation, training, and exam attempts to facilitate a smoother application process.\nStreamline and consolidate Apply for the FCVS and consider participating in the IMLC (depending on your state of primary licensure and intended states in which to practice) to streamline the licensing process.\nPlan ahead Allow adequate time for processing, including unexpected issues that may arise.\nKeep current Keep your licenses active and plan ahead for renewals.\nAsk questions Look to seasoned locums or a locum tenens agency for support, and don’t hesitate to reach out to the medical board directly with questions.\nIf you’re working with a locum tenens agency, most agencies have dedicated licensing and credentialing personnel to help manage the process.\nAgencies also typically have well-established relationships with medical boards, which can help facilitate the process and address questions as they arise.\nWhile there is a lot to consider when managing medical licenses, good planning and supporting a reputable locum tenens agency can help the locum tenens licensing process go more smoothly.\nHow much does locums pay?
